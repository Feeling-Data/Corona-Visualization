The historic building, designed by Scottish architect Charle Rennie Mackintosh, suffered extensive damage from the fire that started on Friday, 15 June 2018.

Glasgow-based architect Alan Dunlop, who visited the site over the weekend, said the destruction caused to the building is ""irreparable"".

""Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art is gone,"" he told Dezeen.

""It is certainly possible to rebuild but you cannot replicate 110 years of history,"" he said. ""The students, artists and architects who have worked there, and whose presence permeated the building – that's what has been lost in the fire.""

""We should resist the calls to rebuild""

Dunlop, who was a student at the Glasgow School of Art and is a visiting professor at Robert Gordon University, Scott Sutherland School of Architecture, claimed the damage is far worse than the school sustained during the previous fire in 2014, which destroyed large sections of the interior.

A reconstruction project following the first fire, costing an estimated £35 million, was expected to complete this year. But Dunlop believes that the same cannot be repeated.

""It has been destroyed by fire, four years after an initial assault,"" he said.

""We should resist the calls to rebuild it as before, 'stone by stone'. That would not be restoration, it would be replication – a process I believe Mackintosh himself would resist, as he was an innovator, not a copyist.""

Damage ""much worse"" than after previous fire

More than 120 firefighters were called to Glasgow School of Art just before midnight on Friday to tackle the blaze, which spread from the building's ground floor all the way up to the roof. Firefighters were able to get the fire under control after several hours.

Aerial photographs released shortly after the fire reveal the extensive damage – the roof appears to have been completely destroyed, and many of the floors are burnt out.

Billy Hare, professor in construction management at Glasgow Caledonian University, estimated the cost of rebuilding at more than £100 million.

""The damage to the school of art appeared to be overwhelming, much worse than the last fire from which recovered materials were painstakingly analysed and used in the refurbishment of the building,"" he told The Scotsman.

""This sort of project will cost a great deal more than the estimated £35 million after the last fire in May 2014.""

Hare expressed doubts over whether it would be possible to recover the school at all.

""It is sadly questionable what, if anything, will be left that could be salvaged, restored or recreated after this fire,"" he told the paper.

""It remains to be seen if it will be possible to retain a facade from the current building. If not, damaged buildings have been taken down almost stone by stone in the past and rebuilt with a new, internal frame.""

Cause of fire unknown

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has confirmed that no casualties were reported.

Martin Hill, the fire officer in charge of the incident, said that thermal-imaging cameras were used to help them assess priorities during a ""tactical firefighting operation"".

The cause of the fire is unknown at this stage, but investigations are underway.

Glasgow School of Art has issued a statement to reassure staff and students that its priority over the coming week will be ""ensure minimum disruption"".

Muriel Gray Chair, chair of the school's board of governors, said she is hopeful that the building can be repaired.

""We now have a difficult waiting game until Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Glasgow City Council and associated agencies have completed their investigations into the condition of the building,"" she said.

""We remain hopeful of as positive an outcome as possible, because it is clear that the love for the Mackintosh and recognition of its importance to Glasgow and the wider world is shared by absolutely everyone.""

Sprinklers weren't in operation

The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association has told press that sprinklers were not yet operational in the building, as the refurbishment wasn't complete.

""However, it should be realised that sprinklers can be fitted in buildings throughout construction on a temporary basis, as there is a considerable risk from fire during this period,"" the association told The Guardian.

Completed in 1909, Glasgow School of Art is the best-known building designed by Mackintosh, Scotland's most famous architect.

Last month marked the 150th anniversary of Mackintosh's birth. Dezeen published a special series to mark the occasion.

I thought it was an old tweet at first, a relic from four years ago: ‘There is a fire at the Mackintosh Building. The fire brigade are currently on scene.’ Then I checked the news and saw the fierce red sky above the Glasgow School of Art and a spasm of shock was followed by confusion. It was happening again – but how? How, in the midst of a major rebuild and so near to completion, could such an important building go up in flames for a second time?

No-one died and so to use the word tragedy to describe the latest cruel twist in the tale of this landmark building’s history may seem hyperbolic. But a tragedy it is, and not just for all those who have passed through its solid black doors, or studied in its richly ornate wood panelled library, or been affected by the sense of the outside streaming in to its light-filled studio spaces. Not just the art school staff, the students, the artists, the gallery visitors, the tourists on the Charles Rennie Mackintosh trail – though of course the rawness of their feelings are real and relevant.

It is a tragedy of memory and pride; a tragedy of place and circumstance; a tragedy that twists a knife into the heart of not just an art school but a city – a largely poor, working-class city with a rich cultural past that is palpable in its present. And for many reasons – not least that, up until that first fire on 23 May 2014, it was a building still used for its original purpose, an architectural gem that more than a hundred years on could still hold its own in an utterly changed world – the Mackintosh Building provides a tangible link between now and then. It embodies so strongly that sense of the present being touched and shaped by the past; of history being lives lived and ideas enacted rather than something you read about in books.

From the a-n News archive:

Reporting on the 2014 fire and aftermath

It is – it was – a living building. A great building, internationally revered, but not a building designed by an international ‘starchitect’; not like GSA’s new Reid Building by US architect Steven Holl, which opened in April 2014 a month before the first fire and has spent most of its short life opposite a construction site. This was designed and built in Scotland’s biggest city by a young Glasgow-born architect. It is in and of this place, and in our global, connected world that seems to make its presence more keenly felt, its value so much greater than its cost.

But is that cost now too great? After a £35m restoration following the first fire, and with the work by Kier Construction Scotland set to be completed by the end of this year and students due to be using the building by 2019, there is now talk that to rebuild it a second time could cost anything from £100-£200m. The latest fire, which began in the east wing, was far fiercer than the first and the building is entirely gutted, a mere shell. Worse still, the intense heat of the fire may have compromised it structurally; there is a possibility, it seems, that this A-listed building will have to be demolished and then rebuilt. Is that possible? Is that even desirable?

Muriel Gray, the chairwoman of the board of Glasgow School of Art who was so vociferous in her support for the building after the 2014 fire, has said it was “an understatement to say everyone is utterly devastated but, as usual, the GSA executive team, staff and students, have been outstanding, positive and supportive”.

As questions are asked about how this fire could even happen, about whether a sprinkler system had been installed in the building – Kier have yet to comment, but reports have suggested it wasn’t in place – the initial numbness experienced by many is turning to understandable anger. Who is to blame? What happens next?

As Gray put it: “We now have a difficult waiting game until Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Glasgow City Council and associated agencies have completed their investigations into the condition of the building. We remain hopeful of as positive an outcome as possible because it is clear that the love for the Mackintosh and recognition of its importance to Glasgow and the wider world is shared by absolutely everyone.”

For now, the building and the surrounding area is cordoned off with police tape and the air is heavy with the smell of the recent fire. We can only hope that the year that marks the 150th anniversary of Mackintosh’s birth will not be remembered for the final demise of his greatest architectural achievement.

As the initial shock of Friday's devastating Glasgow School of Art fire begins to dissipate tough questions are now being asked as to how such a disaster can have been allowed to happen not once, but twice within the span of a mere four years. Here Robin Ward, author of Exploring Glasgow, The Architectural Guide , queries the absence of basic fire protection systems.



Opinion



In 2014, rapid response by firefighters to the notorious fire in the Mackintosh Building at Glasgow School of Art saved 90% of the structure and 70% of its contents. But the school’s Library, Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s world-famous art nouveau interior, was destroyed. A shattering loss. No city has such a symbiotic relationship with its art school, and love for the architect.







A postmortem by the Scottish Fire & Rescue Service identified the cause of the fire—flammable gases from a canister of foam used by a student making art—and why it spread so fast. The SFRS report revealed the ‘Mac’ as a century-old tinderbox, riddled with ventilation ducts and voids which became a conduit for the flames. A sprinkler system had just been fitted but was not operational. It is unlikely it would have contained the blaze. Incredibly, four years on, a second fire started late Friday 15 June and spread swiftly with devastating effect. Glasgow’s most revered work of architecture was gutted. The cause of this catastrophic event is, so far, not known.







The 2014 fire, GSA director Professor Tom Inns said, was a ‘horrible accident’. Of the SFRS report he opined, ‘Obviously there are many features in the building which contributed to the fire—those are the things that are highlighted in the report.’ Lessons would be learned. Not

highlighted in the report, or by Inns, was a failure of stewardship, and negligence.







The GSA’s investment and hype in the years preceding the 2014 blaze had focussed on creating a campus fit for the 21st century, notably the Reid Building (Steve Holl and JM Architects) which opened in 2014 face to face with the Mac across the street. After the fire, restoration of the Library went ahead, prioritized by popular demand. The restoration (Page/Park Architects) was to be have been meticulous, as good as new, and expected to finish next year.







Buildings under repair or restoration are always at risk. What precautions did the GSA put in place? Why was the sprinkler system not finished or improved to protect the bulk of the building the firefighters saved? According to the Guardian, the British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association understood that ‘automatic fire sprinklers had not been fully fitted as the building was still undergoing refurbishment from the 2014 fire.’ The association added, ‘sprinklers can be fitted in buildings throughout construction on a temporary basis.’ Furthermore, with restoration in progress, was anyone hired to fire-watch overnight, every night? It seems not.





After the first fire, no one at the GSA wanted to play the blame game. No heads rolled. But were lessons learned from the SFRS report? On the streets of Glasgow there is shock and anger that such a fire happened again. As for the future, there will be calls for the whole building to be restored. The shell of the Mac survived the inferno but it may not be structurally sound. Intense heat and the sudden spay of water cracked and weakened stonework in 2014. Whole or partial demolition may now be required for public safety. Façadism may be feasible, with a new structure inside.







In any event, a complete copy would be doable—the Mac is comprehensively documented, and a detailed digital modelling of the building was done after the first fire. Indeed, CRM’s design for the House for an Art Lover was built in Glasgow long after he died. But would a replica of the Mac be desirable?







Forensic knowledge was acquired during the restoration of the Library. There will be pressure to restore it again, but to what purpose? The Library was freely used by students when I studied there, when the Mac was a workplace, inspiring but not considered precious. It has since become a shrine, attracting the faithful from around the world.







CRM, long neglected, is now the architectural spirit of Glasgow and his buildings are a tourist attraction, chiefly the Mac. The fire of 2014 generated a huge amount of sympathy and fund-raising to restore the Library. Can that goodwill be sustained to restore the whole building?







The most pressing question, which will provoke debate, is should the Mac be rebuilt as it was, where it was? Would CRM do that or craft something new, with 21st-century materials and technology? Would he apply art nouveau decoration? He would certainly still be a magician of spatial surprise and the effects of light and shade that were the original’s unique personality. Perhaps the school’s architectural students should be given a chance to reinvent the place. CRM was young when he designed the Mac, and created a masterpiece."

As Wales saw all hope of qualifying for France 2019 extinguished and Jane Ross scored a potentially life-changing winner for Scotland in Albania, the most experimental side of Phil Neville’s short international managerial tenure concluded the Lionesses’ World Cup qualifying campaign with a resounding 6-0 Group One win away to Kazakhstan.

England’s 3-0 victory against Wales in Newport last Friday had already guaranteed they would finish top of the group and booked their ticket to next summer’s showpiece across the Channel.



Inspired by the gifted Kim Little, Scotland will now join them. Shelley Kerr’s side celebrated automatic qualification as winners of Group Two courtesy of Ross’s goal in a 2-1 triumph after Little’s early opener had been cancelled out by an Albanian equaliser.

“It’s not often I’m lost for words but I’m really emotional,” said head coach Shelley Kerr. “We’ve done it the hard way during the campaign but we’ve shown great maturity and determination to succeed. These moments don’t come along too often so I’m absolutely ecstatic and it’ll take a while for it to sink in that we’re off to our first World Cup.”

Captain Rachel Corsie added: “At the final whistle it was hard to know what to do. It was just an incredibly surreal feeling. We need to enjoy that and we will because we deserve to. We always felt comfortable in the game and we created more than enough chances to win it. We knew that second goal was coming and we believed that it would. We persevered and once we got it we controlled the game well. The World Cup is the pinnacle of football and to have the opportunity to go over there and be on that stage with the best teams in the world is going to be incredibly special.”

While the visiting celebrations in Shkoder were ecstatic, things were a little lower key in Pavlodar where England ended their qualifying campaign unbeaten with seven wins and one draw. Between now and next June Neville wants intense, and increased, competition for places in his squad and England’s manager used the opportunity of an ostensibly dead rubber against the group’s bottom side by making 11 changes from the side who started at Rodney Parade. The England team who ran out against Kazakhstan duly contained seven players making their full debuts.

Considering their hosts had scored only twice during a dismal qualifying campaign – and one of those was an own goal – such inexperience did not hamper Neville’s players. By half-time a Beth Mead penalty and another goal from Rachel Daly had put them two up.

Neville describes the latter, Houston Dash utility player as “seven footballers all rolled into one” and, deployed as a forward on this occasion, Daly – who has also excelled at left-back recently – once again emphasised her versatility.

Alongside her and Mead, Reading’s Lauren Bruton also shone as she won her first cap but it was Izzy Christiansen – the midfielder who swapped Manchester City for Lyon this summer – who put Neville’s side three up in the 54th minute following Bruton’s cross.

Another debutant, Birmingham’s Lucy Staniforth, - who has overcome two ruptured cruciate ligaments - claimed a 66th-minute fourth before England won another penalty. This time, though, Arsenal’s Mead missed, hitting a post.

Undeterred, Mead soon atoned by shooting the fifth and Bruton created the sixth for the substitute Lucy Bronze as Welsh play-off hopes evaporated.

Although Ludlow’s side, who for a time were above England in their group table and held Neville’s players to a 0-0 draw at Southampton last April, finished second, they were not one of the four best qualifiers across seven groups. Having completed their fixtures, Ludlow’s players were left on tenterhooks waiting to see if other results went their way.

Agonisingly they did not. Germany, Norway and Sweden joined Scotland in clinching automatic qualification Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands found themselves consigned to the lottery of two play-off games to determine the final European place at France 2019.

Considering the Netherlands are European Champions – they beat England in the semi-finals of Euro 2017 before defeating Denmark in the final – their failure to qualify automatically will be seen as a setback."

The SNP certainly believes that a hard Brexit will boost the case for Scottish independence, while also making much of the different treatment of Northern Ireland.","northern, customs, scotland, union, uk, eu, needs, driving, brexit, market, ireland, risks, remain, heres, change, single","In the 1975 European Communities membership referendum, it was England that returned the biggest majority for the UK joining the common market: 69%. Northern Ireland’s 52% support was the smallest. Next came Scotland on 58%, though it included the only two regions in the UK that voted to stay out – the Shetland Islands and the Western Isles.

In the Brexit referendum of 2016, the political dynamics had reversed. Now voters in England and Wales voted to leave the EU, while Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain. This difference has set the tone for much of what has happened since. As Theresa May returns from Brussels to try and sell her withdrawal deal to parliament, the Union is straining like never before.

After the 2016 referendum came the inevitable debate about whether Scotland and Northern Ireland could avoid leaving the single market against their will. Six months after the vote, the Scottish government published a blueprint for achieving this by Scotland becoming a member of the European Economic Area after the UK leaves. The UK government refused to even entertain the idea of a differentiated Scottish Brexit.

Northern Ireland is being treated very differently. May made clear at her Lancaster House speech in early 2017 that the UK government aimed to leave the single market and customs union without returning a hard border to Ireland – after all, the Good Friday Agreement constitutionally guaranteed Northern Ireland’s right to remain in the EU.

In December of the same year, the UK and EU duly reached a political agreement that introduced the “backstop”. This envisaged that if the UK-EU trade deal did not provide for a frictionless Irish border, either Northern Ireland or the UK as a whole would remain aligned to the single market and the customs union after Brexit took place.

The new backstop

The notion of Northern Ireland remaining in parts of the single market was outrageous to many, not least the DUP. The backstop now appears somewhat differently in the “Northern Ireland protocol” codified in the draft withdrawal treaty. Barring a deal on free trade, the UK as a whole will remain in a “bare bones” customs union with the EU; while Northern Ireland will additionally remain aligned to the single market rules necessary to maintain free movement of goods across the Irish border.

Despite the shift from the original plan, this has attracted significant opposition. Prominent Brexiteers, Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson, the Scottish Conservatives and most importantly the DUP argue that it threatens the “constitutional integrity” of the UK and the Union itself.

This is a gross and needless overstatement. Northern Ireland already significantly differentiates from the rest of the UK, even in the area of protection of fundamental rights. For example, same-sex marriages are not recognised there. The laws around abortion are much more restrictive (though may need reform after the UK supreme court said earlier this year that they were incompatible with human rights law).

There are a number of cases where different parts of a member state have different relationships with the EU – Greenland is different from the rest of Denmark, for example. The UK already makes extensive use of this flexibility. Gibraltar, for instance, is outside the customs union and EU VAT area and is not part of the Common Agricultural Policy.

The sovereignty of a member state over a region has never been challenged just because EU law is applied differently there. Neither is it unique for a region to be more aligned to the EU than the rest of its metropolitan state. The Austrian territories of Jungholz and Mittelberg have been part of the EU customs territory since it was established – decades before Austria joined the EU in 1995. Meanwhile, in a special protocol of the UK withdrawal agreement, it has been agreed that another region with a constitutional relationship with the UK will remain in the EU customs territory – the UK Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus.

The need for change

Notwithstanding the questionable legal validity of these arguments about the threat that the “Northern Ireland protocol” poses to the constitutional integrity of the UK, there remain serious questions about the current Union. The SNP certainly believes that a hard Brexit will boost the case for Scottish independence, while also making much of the different treatment of Northern Ireland.

Yet the UK constitution is sufficiently flexible that it could accommodate the nations’ different aspirations concerning Europe. Scotland could be allowed to tailor its own migration policy, for instance, as Quebec does in Canada. The UK government’s unwillingness to consider such possibilities flies in the face of an important lesson from the 2014 Scottish independence referendum: promising more devolved powers to Scotland near the end of the campaign helped to deliver the decision to stay in the Union.

The reality is that Brexit is an unprecedented challenge to the idiosyncratic UK constitution. Scotland’s inability to influence the withdrawal agreement has revealed important weaknesses around how the nations relate to the centre. The mechanisms for the intergovernmental cooperation between London and Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh should be strengthened to take into account the aspirations and positions of all UK constituent nations.

Brexit also needs to urgently respect the legislative autonomy of the devolved regions and avoid what has been called a “Westminster power grab”. Finally, we need to dispense with any notion that Northern Ireland remaining in the EU single market is a threat to its place in the Union.

There is an inherent contradiction in the uber-unionist position as expressed by the likes of the DUP and certain members of the Conservative Party. Unless they actively respect the differentiation that devolution introduced, the nations might conclude that secession is the most appropriate way to exercise their right for self-determination.

As Prince Tancredi Falconeri said in the classic 1950s novel The Leopard: “Everything must change so that everything can stay the same.”"

Division rules at Westminster, Stormont remains deadlocked, and the Scottish National Party is poised to call for a second independence referendum. Meanwhile, polling in England suggests that many people think breaking up the UK is perhaps a price worth paying to deliver Brexit.

Throughout the Brexit process, the prime minister has reiterated her desire to secure a deal that “strengthens the bonds” that unite the four component parts of the UK – England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. From the outset, however, this has proven to be more a false promise than a political reality.

At the referendum, only two of the four component parts of the UK – England and Wales – voted to leave the EU. This was enough to swing an overall UK-wide majority in favour of leave, but it went against the will of the Scottish and Northern Irish electorate. In both these parts of the country, significant majorities voted to remain – 62% and 55.8%, respectively.

Despite this, the UK government interpreted the result as reflecting a position of UK-wide solidarity. The UK would leave the EU “as one”, with no differentiated deals for any part of the UK.

Nevertheless, the devolved administrations have routinely highlighted the need for any deal to reflect the opinion of each of the component parts of the UK, and for the devolved administrations to play an active role in deliberations. To date, the role of the devolved administrations in this process has been limited, and subject to the final decision-making power of the UK government.

A second referendum?

All this raises the question of how things would shake out in a second referendum. It is relatively safe to assume that majorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland would vote to remain, were it an option on the ballot. And despite its original vote, a recent opinion poll, suggests Wales would now also vote to remain. But there is far less certainty about England.

This creates the dilemma that if England votes contrary to the rest of the UK, the fallout could further reaffirm the incongruity of territorial politics in the UK. On the one hand, should England’s vote be lost within a UK-wide majority that matches the vote in the devolved nations, the demands for an English “voice” within the Union would likely gain additional traction. This is doubly significant as Brexit has been interpreted as an expression of English nationalism which, if suppressed in a second vote, may pose further problems down the line.

On the other hand, if England’s vote swings the overall UK result in its favour, the devolved administrations would once again see their choice unrepresented in a “national” vote.

Under this scenario, if the UK government were to again follow the will of only part of the UK, and fail to effectively address the arguments of the devolved administrations, the constitutional repercussions could be severe. Such a scenario could hand significant capital to nationalist groups, adding fuel to the SNP’s demands for a fresh independence vote, as well as likely bolstering support for nationalists in Wales.

Even if every part of the UK voted to remain, it is likely that events of the past few years will still leave their mark. While this scenario may promise a short-term fix, it is unlikely to provide a long-term solution to the UK’s constitutional woes. The UK government’s actions throughout the Brexit process will serve as a lasting reminder to those in the devolved parts of the UK – particularly the nationalists – of their lack of equality within the territorial constitution.

Events such as the UK government’s decision to pass the EU (Withdrawal) Act without securing the consent of the Scottish government, the limited reference to the devolved parts of the UK in the draft withdrawal agreement, and the threats that have been allowed to emerge to the Good Friday Agreement and the Irish border, each leave a lasting precedent of vulnerability and distrust in the minds of the devolved administrations.

With this in mind, it is unlikely that a second referendum will deliver salvation for the Union. Instead, there needs to be a much broader and long-lasting change in Westminster culture. The UK government needs to promote the equality and security of the UK’s component parts in the decision-making process and provide for the security of the devolution settlements. Considering the current political landscape, it appears that only through such long-lasting changes will Brexit potentially strengthen the bonds of the United Kingdom."

One has seen Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, hold talks with her UK counterpart Theresa May over the ongoing Brexit crisis; and confirming she will clarify plans for a second Scottish independence referendum in the coming weeks. The other involved the shock of seeing Sturgeon’s predecessor Alex Salmond appear in court charged with attempted rape and sexual assault.

What do these mean for the SNP and a second independence referendum? Salmond is the party’s most prominent figure of the last 30 years, who led the Scottish government for seven years and brought about the independence referendum of 2014. There’s little that can be said about the specifics of this live legal case, but the fact any case has been brought can only be damaging to the SNP and the independence effort – contrary to Sturgeon’s claims that it would make no difference. There are also risks from the numerous other inquiries into alleged procedural misconduct over the Scottish government’s investigation of the Salmond allegations, including one into Sturgeon herself.

With the Brexit crisis there are both opportunities and threats – all tied to the independence question. It’s worth remembering at the outset that much SNP electoral success from 2007-14 was not down to its backing independence but its attractiveness as a party of government and its ability to implement policy and govern effectively.

SNP popularity spiked following the independence referendum, in which Yes support rose from roughly a third to 45% of the electorate. To some extent, increased independence support gave the party a second electoral wind in the UK election of 2015 and the Scottish election of 2016. At the same time, you have to acknowledge the SNP’s durability and success in winning successive elections in government during very economically hard times.

The 2017 misstep

But Scotland is now 11 years into austerity, and the party has governed the whole time. The SNP minority government currently faces problems over the NHS, local government, the Scotrail franchise, Scottish levels of taxation, education policy and a threatened strike by schoolteachers. Despite these, opinion poll support for the party remains strong if not at the levels of previous years.

Keeping that going is challenging, however, and the party has definitely made political missteps over independence. Look back to the Brexit referendum of June 2016 and you see the independence referendum that might have been, as 62% of Scots backed Remain against a UK Leave of 52%. Seeing the potential to convert this into Yes support north of 60%, the SNP launched a short-lived precursor campaign to a second independence referendum.

It created a national survey consultation exercise on Brexit, independence, policy and identity, which yielded about 2m responses – creating the dataset for a future referendum. The party also very publicly launched the fundraising website ScotRef, raising about half of its £1m target.

The referendum didn’t get off the ground, of course. Attempts to get permission from the UK government were rebuffed by May and then swept side by the UK election result in 2017. The SNP lost a third of its seats, again for complex reasons: among other factors, the party’s strong backing for EU Remain had alienated some who favoured Brexit, while No supporters who had previously backed the party deserted it over the push for a second independence referendum. Salmond was among the SNP members who lost his seat.

The topic of another independence referendum has since been very difficult for Sturgeon and her party. In parallel to the unionist problem, there is internal pressure from party members and supporters and the wider Yes movement for another vote. This prompted substantial public demonstrations by independence supporters in 2018.

The party has three choices: demand another referendum, wait and see or hold one without London’s permission. On the latter option, there is regular talk among campaigners about doing a Catalan-style DIY referendum. The legal process would be murky, however, and opponents would probably boycott the poll and damage the legitimacy of the result. This would raise problems for international recognition and EU membership, to say the least.

Waiting also has its problems, though, as the SNP’s 2016 “mandate” for another referendum slides and the party and Yes movement lose momentum over independence. Seeking a new mandate in the next Scottish parliamentary election of 2021, when the SNP may lose more electoral support, has a serious downside too.

The case for being positive

That leaves “demand” to consider. And here there is some positive news for the SNP. In recent months, the party has pivoted towards backing a second EU referendum. This allows the party to link independence and Europe at a time of great stress and problems for the UK state and political system.

It also legitimises the idea of a second independence referendum and has allowed the SNP to reach Remain voters who do not support either the party or independence. What it does with Leavers is a continuing problem, though, and it forces SNP leaders to spend time asking for something they’re probably not going to get from the UK government – not least in Sturgeon’s latest meeting with May.

Were there a so-called people’s vote, a repeat of 2016’s Leave victory might well make the Union more unattractive to No supporters. On the other hand, a Remain would cancel the SNP’s 2016 mandate, but would at least neutralise the potentially tricky issue in any future independence campaign of Scotland wanting to be inside the EU while its southern neighbour was not.

If there is not to be another EU referendum, the question then is how the Brexit crisis spirals in the next few weeks. This presumably explains Sturgeon’s plan to reveal her hand on a second independence referendum soon but not yet – no doubt while continuing to distance herself and her party from the Salmond case and the related inquiries. It’s still extremely difficult to call how all this potentially impacts on independence. But without question, the stakes have never looked higher for the Yes campaign as the clock ticks down towards Brexit on March 29."

An escape room is an increasingly popular adventure game that requires participants to solve a series of puzzles before they can leave the room and advance into another one with additional riddles.

Brexit now seems to be a riddle that can’t be solved, after U.K. lawmakers voted down Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to leave the European Union. This means there’s no way to “win,” yet no clear way to end the game that began with a 2016 referendum.

That’s bad news for the British. But based on my research on international business, that’s bad news for U.S. businesses and the “special relationship” between the two countries as well.

This decades-long relationship, based on common values and similar views on global issues, has been weakened by President Donald Trump and will deteriorate further without a post-Brexit plan.

The Brexit puzzle

The first escape room was relatively easy to solve, consisting of just one puzzle: leave or remain.

In June 2016, British citizens narrowly voted to exit the union it joined in 1973, which moved the U.K. into the next room.

The second one was more complicated, since it required the U.K. to resolve domestic divisions over Brexit. Citizens who wished to remain – majorities in London, Scotland and Northern Island – refused to participate in the game any further, other than to urge fellow players to return to the first room and answer that puzzle differently by holding another referendum.

The remaining participants, specifically the majority Conservative Party led by May, started fighting among themselves while trying to solve the puzzle of what the U.K. wanted from Brexit.

This room took the longest time to leave – over two years – since it required specific and lengthy negotiations on the terms of Brexit with the EU. Having reached an agreement, the prime minister stumbled out of this room in November with her supporters and presented the plan to Parliament.

No road map for US business

That plan went down in a stunning defeat on Jan. 15 – May lost 432-202 in the biggest upset in parliamentary history – putting the U.K. in uncharted territory.

Opponents are pushing for new elections or another referendum – back to the first room – while May’s own party is discussing ways for Parliament to take control of Brexit. And the EU says the deal cannot be renegotiated before the March 29 deadline.

Back in June 2016, before the referendum, I explained why Americans should care about the vote’s outcome, in part because Brexit would hurt U.S.-U.K. trade and investment. But it is clear to me now that the impact will extend beyond business to the essence of the “special relationship” between the two countries.

U.S. companies still have no road map for how to proceed. Uncertainty reigns on tariffs, regulations, whether to locate staff in the U.K. versus Europe and countless more business-related issues.

Business hates uncertainty. Foreign investment in the U.K. has already dropped 19 percent over the past two years as companies have been wary to invest in or expand their operations. Banks and other American companies seem more interested in closer ties to the EU’s single market than doing business in the U.K.

This disinvestment is likely to accelerate following the failed vote in Parliament. Sadly, it looks like Brexit is a game without a winner or, at this point, any obvious way of quitting."

Who gets to fish in UK waters and how much they get to fish, as well as the UK fishing industry’s access to EU markets, have been front and centre of debates over the UK’s future relationship with the EU.

It’s widely recognised that the UK fishing industry voted for Brexit. The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which regulates fishing rights in the EU, is seen as a huge source of discontent among UK fishermen. But having interviewed key people in northeast Scotland’s fishing industry this summer, our conversations revealed a much more nuanced position on Brexit than is often portrayed in the media.

Perhaps most notably, some fishermen suggested that Brexit is not entirely about reversing the CFP, in the sense that foreign vessels should be banned from accessing UK fish stocks in UK waters. Rather, it is about the UK managing its own waters after Brexit more fairly than is possible within the CFP. There is an awareness that most UK fish exports are destined for EU markets and so maintaining a good working relationship is important. For example, one fisherman said:

I’m not also advocating that no foreign boat should be allowed in the UK, that would be wrong in my opinion. They have historical rights as well fishing our waters, it’s just the allocation of it.

Fair fishing for all

In fact, the CFP is credited with some positives, such as bringing in management rules that helped the industry survive. But most agree that the CFP is now a burden to the industry that imposes impractical rules like the discard ban and gives away a UK resource at the cost of the UK fishing industry. As one fisherman put it:

To me the Common Fisheries Policy has been a disastrous policy for the fishing industry round the UK. Okay, it’s conserved the stocks but it’s decimated the fishing communities round about the UK.

Andy Forse

There is also an awareness of the possibility that the fishing industry ends up in a worse position, if negotiations with the EU go badly. What they want is for the UK government to provide a plan that ensures the future of their industry and their communities, while dealing fairly with fishermen from the EU, where a significant part of their business plan relies on access to UK waters.

This understanding of the potential plight of their fellow fishermen from Europe, were the UK waters to be closed to foreign vessels, is reflected in one person’s comments:

I do not think it is fair that on a vote of the UK that a man who has built up a business in Denmark, Holland, France all of a sudden loses out overnight. I think we should be man enough to say we’re changing the rules and we’re going to do it over a ten to 15-year period.

There is also concern that the current Brexit transition period leaves the fishing industry within the CFP while the UK has no say in its operation. But this is minor compared to the fear that the UK will leave the EU and remain in the CFP.

Little confidence in negotiations

Interviewees recognise that the fishing industry is of low economic importance to the UK and have little confidence in the negotiation. The largest concern is that, as part of the negotiations to withdraw from the EU, the fishing industry is used as leverage in wider trade negotiations and ends up in the same or a worse position. One person said:

It will just be a bargaining chip, the industry is nothing to the GDP in the UK, it’s less than 1%. Well, if you go to Denmark, you go to Holland, they all fight for their fishermen. France, Spain, you take the financial market in London, they’ll sacrifice the fishing industry to keep it.

The industry also cares about a future EU-UK trade deal, as the majority of fish products exported from the UK go to the EU. Currently, there are no tariffs or customs checks on these products. But there are concerns that tariffs on seafood exports would increase the price of their products which could reduce sales. Plus, any delays from customs checks would reduce the quality of the fresh produce as it increases the time between catching and arriving at supermarkets and restaurants on the continent. One fisherman summed up his concerns on trade and markets:

I think the main risk is our markets in Europe. I have a fear that there’s a closed-door there and we have a perishable commodity and we have lorries backing up at the channel and fish decreasing in quality, you know, that can hit the price in the market for us.

Clearly, there are fears over how things will pan out. The fishing industry voted for Brexit to escape the rules and regulations of the CFP, many of which are seen as troublesome at best. But the ongoing Brexit negotiations have provided no certainty or clarity to the fishing industry, which both fears its decline and hopes for an outcome that enables a renaissance in the UK’s coastal communities."

Is the UK headed for dissolution?

The United Kingdom is made up of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

The publication of the Brexit draft withdrawal agreement - a hefty 585-page tome - has revealed what has been implicit in the “British” vote to leave the EU all along: that Brexit is an expression of English nationalism that will unwittingly lead to the break-up of the UK.

Read more: Brexit deal: how UK and EU got here and what happens next

Behind the government’s rhetoric of “global Britain”, there is no such thing as the “British people” in a political sense any more. The referendum revealed significant divisions between attitudes to EU membership in Scotland, Northern Ireland and England. While Prime Minister Theresa May tried to reposition “global Britain” in relation to Europe and the rest of the world, Britain itself dissolved from within.

Prime Minister Theresa May refers to the UK as a “precious union”. If only more people felt the same. An LBC-YouGov poll in March found that a majority of (mostly English) voters wanted to leave the EU rather than keep Northern Ireland in the UK.

In October, research published by the Centre on Constitutional Change showed that a clear majority of English leave voters would be happy to see Scotland and Northern Ireland out of the UK as the price of Brexit.

The irony is that it is the resistance of 10 MPs from the Ulster loyalist Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and about 60 hard-line English Conservative Brexiteersis most likely to plunge the UK into an existential crisis. Their intransigence will destroy the thing they profess to defend.

Read more: As Brexit begins, Australia mustn’t get caught up in Britain’s post-imperial fantasies

The text of the Brexit draft withdrawal agreement was at pains to appease concerns among the Ulster unionist community about maintaining the integrity of the UK (unsuccessfully as it turned out).

The prospect of the agreed backstop – a single customs territory that the UK could not leave without EU consent and which would ultimately keep Northern Ireland in a special relationship with the EU after Brexit – was not something Brexiteers and the DUP could stomach.

For them, the deal was a “capitulation”. It was a breach of “blood red” lines that invoked the prospect of a return to conflict in Ulster.

Across the Irish Sea, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, asked: if Northern Ireland got special treatment, why not Scotland too?

In fact, the withdrawal agreement made no mention of Scotland at all. This disregard for the overwhelming Scottish vote to remain in the EU has pushed Scotland closer to another referendum on independence.

Brexit has created a new and deep cleavage in British politics that cuts across old political divisions. Far fewer people identify as Labour or Conservative than identify as “leave” or “remain”.

Add the national dimension to this politics and some new options emerge. Some hard Brexiteers must be considering ditching Scotland and Northern Ireland as an acceptable cost for “British” (read “English”) independence from the EU.

The ghost of empire has haunted the Brexit imaginary from before the 2016 referendum. Its critics derided “global Britain” as “Empire 2.0”. But the memory of empire cuts two ways. Brexiteers see the EU as a threatening imperium. The withdrawal agreement would leave the UK as a vassal state - a state that is subordinate to another - and therefore must be rejected.

Would a second referendum help?

Brexit has also left unresolved questions about who is actually in charge in Britain. Calls for a second referendum have grown, suggesting “the people” rather than government or parliament is the ultimate source of authority on this matter.

A second referendum has the advantage of presenting the electorate with a concrete proposal for leaving. It would temper the unrealistic and downright false claims of the leave campaign in 2016. It might end the talk of “respecting the wishes of the British people” to leave the EU.

In truth we don’t really know what exactly people voted for: only 6% of leave voters said they thought Britain would be better off economically by leaving.

But a general election would be a better bet. It would effectively be a referendum on the deal. It might also return a government with a majority – something Britain has lacked since May’s miscalculation last year.

Australia’s role

What does this mean for Australia? Australia was name-checked in Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday as a country offering the prospect of a quick free trade agreement. Britain needs Australia in a way that it hasn’t since world war two. It would be best at this delicate moment to stop recklessly encouraging the British government from the sidelines: no more talk of one-page free trade agreements.

Australia must continue with its (slow) progress on the Australia-EU free trade agreement negotiations begun in June. The EU has remained remarkably unified during the Brexit negotiations despite tensions of its own. The EU is coming out of its own crises of the past decade. Now it’s Britain’s turn to teeter on the brink of disintegration."

In contrast to UK-wide targets for lowering migration, political leaders, local authorities and civil society organisations in Scotland agree that the country needs to continue to attract and retain migrants if it hopes to meet a range of social, economic and population goals for the future.

Our recent report found that policymakers must consider the combination of goals they wish a new immigration policy to achieve. Crucially, they must also take account of the varied needs and choices of migrant workers and the attractiveness of the UK as a destination.

Immigration after Brexit

As Brexit negotiations grind on, it seems highly likely that an end to free movement will be part of whatever deal is reached – or no deal even. This raises concerns about how Scotland and other parts of the UK will recruit sufficient labour, particularly for lower-skilled and low-paid jobs in areas such as social care, agriculture, food processing, construction and hospitality.

Until now a significant proportion of these jobs have been filled by workers from the EU. Even before Britain has left the EU there have been difficulties. Nurses and care workers from Europe have left the UK in higher numbers since 2016. In agriculture, difficulties recruiting workers to the soft fruits sector have resulted in considerable losses as produce rots unpicked in the fields.

Current proposals for managing immigration for these kinds of jobs after Brexit are short-term schemes with restrictions that require migrants to leave the UK at the end of their stay. This is in marked contrast to the open-ended flexibility provided by free movement which has included rights to change employer, access to benefits, rights to family reunion, and relatively straightforward opportunities to settle.

Our report reviews a range of options available to policymakers when designing programmes to manage migration for lower-skilled jobs. Drawing on case studies from other industrialised countries such as Canada, Germany, Spain and Sweden, it shows that a variety of possibilities, incorporating different “bundles” of rights and restrictions, exist. Future immigration policy will have an impact not only on the types of migrants who are willing to come to, or settle in Scotland, but perhaps more worryingly on the country’s ability to attract migrant workers at all.

Who will come?

The report shows how the flexibility of free movement has shaped decisions made by EU migrant workers and their families over recent years. Younger, unattached migrants and those coming for a short term to earn better wages are unlikely be put off by restrictions on length of stay, access to welfare or family rights.

However, a desire to settle long term often emerges over time, and an overly restrictive system, especially if perceived to be unfair or complicated, may encourage overstaying of visas and other undocumented forms of migration and irregular migrant employment.

If longer-term stays are desired as a policy goal – as is the case in Scotland – then social and family rights are crucial. Families with young children and those seeking to settle are those most likely to be deterred by a more restrictive system. In many rural areas of Scotland, where migrants are overwhelmingly employed in lower-waged jobs, it is precisely the combination of social and economic rights allowed by free movement that have encouraged and facilitated their longer-term settlement.

What can be done?

Whatever programme is adopted after Brexit, the UK as a whole and Scotland will have to compete with other countries for migrant workers. For EU citizens, other countries within the EU where free movement still exists will become more attractive. And if entry requirements to the UK become as complex as those in other English-speaking countries such as the US, Canada or Australia, which offer warmer climates and stronger economies, these may also emerge as competition, especially for younger migrants with good English.

If EU citizens become less willing to take up jobs in the UK, this might be offset by recruiting immigrants from further afield. But employers, local communities and service providers would have to make (perhaps costly) adjustments to accommodate such a shift. Looking to the future, policymakers, employers and local authorities will need to balance a range of labour market, social and population goals in developing new immigration policies.

Crucially, they must also consider how different programmes are likely to affect migrant decisions on mobility and settlement. A shift to a more restrictive system is likely to have substantial negative long-term effects on the supply of EU citizens into lower-skilled jobs.

This will likely have wider knock-on effects for particular industries and for local communities. A recent study exploring the potential impact on the agricultural sector in Scotland found that nearly two-thirds of farmers would have to switch to other agricultural activities or diversify into non-agricultural activities. Meanwhile, falling recruitment to the social care sector could worsen an already looming crisis in social care as Scotland’s population ages and more and more people need care."

Essentially, this law would allow all EU law regarding Scotland to transfer to the Scottish parliament after Brexit.
So now there is a stalemate between the legal advisors of the Scottish Parliament and those of the Scottish government.","westminster, raised, scotland, law, uk, consent, bill, constitutional, brexit, powers, devolution, stakes, parliament, scottish","The extraordinary scenes at Westminster on June 13, as parliament decided on the European Union Withdrawal Bill, did not portray the “Mother of All parliaments” in the best light. The government’s decision to cram this significant constitutional debate on amendments made by the House of Lords into just a few hours created mayhem.

For Scotland, the 15 minutes allocated to the devolution question reached farcical proportions, resulting in a walkout by the SNP group during the parliamentary centrepiece, Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs). Worse, despite the Scottish parliament withholding its consent to the bill as it stood, the relevant section – Clause 11, concerning powers currently held in Brussels and where they would go when the UK leaves the EU in 2019 – was voted through unaltered.

At one point the Welsh Assembly also felt that Westminster was looking to “grab” as many as 111 different powers from Europe which should be administered by the devolved bodies. But through negotiations this was reduced to around 20 areas of dispute, the main ones being related to farming and environmental regulations concerning food, such as packaging.

In April Wales agreed to UK frameworks having oversight of these remaining areas so there could be a common approach for the UK economy, but this was a compromise too far for the Scottish government. The argument is that agreeing to the sharing of any powers from Brussels with the UK goes against the principles of the devolution settlement.

The Scotland Act 1998 which created devolution adopted a “reserved powers” model. This meant that all powers listed as such in the legislation would be things that Scotland could not make laws on. Correspondingly, the logic went, if an issue was not covered by a reserved power, the Scottish parliament had the right to legislate on it. The default position then, is for all powers currently in Brussels to go to Holyrood – as they are not identified as reserved matters. For Westminster to assume them is being regarded as a “power grab” by many in Scotland.

Unusually in these polarised times, this position is shared across all the parties in the Scottish parliament – SNP, Labour, Lib Dems and Greens – with the exception of the Conservatives. When Holyrood voted to withhold its consent to the Withdrawal Bill by 93:30, it was dismissed by Conservative spokesperson Adam Tomkins as the “dullest constitutional crisis in history” by focusing on fairly obscure policy areas of dispute.

But concerns over food packaging aside, the longer-term constitutional significance revolves around the Westminster parliament ignoring Holyrood’s lack of consent.

No consent

Legislative Consent Motions (also known as Sewel Motions) have been part of devolution since 1999. Whenever Westminster wants to pass laws that indirectly touch on matters that are largely devolved, it formally seeks consent from the Scottish parliament. This has happened 173 times –- and it has been granted almost every time.

The one other occasion where Holyrood refused to pass a consent motion was over the controversial austerity-led Welfare Reform Bill 2011 which introduced the bedroom tax and the benefit cap among other things. Labour and SNP MSPs were united in this. But, like the current Brexit Bill, the law was passed in London regardless.

Though welfare was largely a matter reserved to Westminster, in this case there are powers that could be regarded as matters for the devolved parliament. The combination of Westminster ignoring Holyrood’s decision to withhold consent and the principles underpinning the devolved settlement could have long-term implications. This could potentially affect how the Scottish government deals with Westminster on a day to day basis.

It may also see the balance of forces in Scotland swing back in favour of another independence referendum. This demand has stalled somewhat following Theresa May’s refusal to grant a section 30 order which would allow a “legal” referendum to take place in 2017. But these events could revive the call to separate from the rest of the UK.

Supreme Court challenge

The constitutional disputes and legal arguments don’t end there. In March, as it refused consent to the Westminster Brexit bill, the Scottish parliament passed its own Brexit law – the Continuity Bill – using emergency procedures. Essentially, this law would allow all EU law regarding Scotland to transfer to the Scottish parliament after Brexit. The support for this bill also crossed party boundaries in Scotland – once again with the exception of the Conservatives.

But this bill is not yet law because of another constitutional problem. The presiding officer – the chair who oversees the running of Holyrood and its debates – ruled that the proposed law was outside the powers of the Scottish parliament. It breached the Scotland Act as it proposed to change European Union Law, which it is explicitly prevented in the 1998 law.

However the lord advocate – Scotland’s chief legal officer – disagreed, arguing that the law was preemptive and seeking to deal with the situation after the UK (including Scotland) had left the European Union.

So now there is a stalemate between the legal advisors of the Scottish Parliament and those of the Scottish government. This has allowed the UK government to refer the matter to the Supreme Court to issue final judgment on whether Holyrood has the power to pass the bill before Royal Assent is given – normally a formality.

This power of referral has always existed in the devolved settlement with Scotland, but has never been used until now – the hearings are scheduled for July 24. In the current atmosphere this could be explosive, as the Supreme Court has the power to block this bill completely –- something that is not possible with Westminster laws.

With the Scottish parliament ignored by Westminster and the Supreme Court potentially striking down its Brexit bill, this conflict could emerge from the constitutional morass into a summer of rallying cries for more powers for Scotland."

The plethora of questions stemming from this Brexit mantra have already threatened to steer the UK towards a new constitutional crisis. And now, in an unprecedented move, the Scottish parliament is expected to, for the first time, refuse a legislative consent motion (LCM) from the UK government relating to the EU Withdrawal Bill.

First minister Nicola Sturgeon has called it part of Scotland fighting back against attempts to undermine the devolved administrations, and Westminster’s opportunistic Brexit “power-grab”. But it may also just be the first step in a new bid for Scottish independence, and ultimately a constitutional crisis for the whole country.

Sometimes referred to as a Sewel motion, a LCM is a motion passed by the Scottish parliament, Welsh assembly or Northern Irish assembly indicating their respective agreement to Westminster passing new laws in areas that they would traditionally have control of – for example health or education.

LCMs operate on the basis that, by convention, the UK legislature will not normally pass laws that either directly affect a devolved subject matter – areas which are typically controlled by the devolved government such as health, or education, for example – , or change the competence, or powers, of a devolved legislature or its ministers, without consent to do so.

However, while these rules exist politically (and have been recognised in the Scotland Act and Wales Act), they are not legally binding. Nor do they limit the sovereign power of the UK parliament.

Devolution disputes

Since 2017, both the Scottish and Welsh governments have disputed the repatriation of powers from Brussels to the UK in areas that are theoretically of devolved importance, but in practice are governed by EU law (which currently takes precedence over domestic rules).

The devolved governments’ concerns relate to 24 retained areas of control, including agriculture and fisheries. At present, the UK government, under the “constitutionally insensitive” clause 11 of the Brexit Bill, states that they should have power to amend “retained EU law”, rather than Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.

The UK government argues that they need to retain these powers, for an intermittent period of time, so as to create a new UK-wide legal framework to replace EU legislation. It claims this is needed to protect the UK markets, and avoid a direct impact on trade via divergence across the different UK regions.

The Scottish government, however, argues that such action defies the will of the Scottish people who voted in favour of Scottish devolution. Sturgeon has said that the UK government cannot be trusted with devolution, and the principle issue is that “the consent of the Scottish parliament to the removal of any of its powers should be an absolute prerequisite”.

Scotland’s Brexit minister Mike Russell has added that refusing the LCM presents the Scottish parliament with a powerful opportunity to unite together and “protect the powers of devolution”, by sending a signal that Scotland will not accept attempts to constrain their powers.

Although these are both strong political sentiments, refusing a LCM – alone – is less likely to achieve legal impact on the Brexit Bill.

Scotland fronting the challenge

By contrast, following months of negotiations, the majority of Welsh assembly members (AMs) are expected to back the Brexit Bill, and approve the LCM. This is on the basis that the EU powers will be held in Westminster for up to seven years before being devolved back to Wales.

But why the differing opinions over LCMs? It is worth noting the different political climate in Wales compared to Scotland. The majority of Welsh constituencies voted in favour of Brexit. And there are a higher percentage of UKIP and Conservative AMs in Wales compared to MSPs in Scotland.

Furthermore, with the collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland, there is no official government representing Nothern Irish views in these negotiations.

Where next?

The legal reality is, even if the Scottish parliament refuses to approve a LCM, Brexit legislation will not be delayed. Furthermore, the UK government has already indicated that it is willing to challenge Scotland over its recent legislation pertaining to Brexit. But, as in previous cases, it is likely that the Scottish government will similarly want to launch a legal challenge in the Supreme Court. This time relating to new laws that go against the devolved legal competence of Scotland.

However, given UK sovereignty rules, and that the Supreme Court has already stated that LCMs are just political conventions – and that policing their scope and manner “does not lie within the constitutional remit of the judiciary” – it seems unlikely that Scotland will enjoy much success in pursuing such arguments.

But that won’t be the end of things. Instead, the looming constitutional crisis may come politically. There will likely be consequences for Westminster, which will be seen as defying the will of the Scottish people “again”. They voted in favour of devolution after all. Scotland also voted against Brexit, and yet is having to go through with it too. With this backdrop the whole country may very well be heading towards a new constitutional crisis and a second Scottish independence referendum."

Negotiators have agreed that the UK will effectively remain part of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy, but without a direct say in its rules, until 2021.

News of the deal was met with anger from organisations representing fishermen, with the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation chief executive, Bertie Armstrong, stating that it “falls far short of an acceptable deal”. The National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations has spoken of UK capitulation to EU demands.

It is in direct contradiction of the assurances of Michael Gove, environment secretary and Brexit campaigner. Earlier this month, he told the fishing industry that the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) would no longer apply and that the UK would effectively become an independent coastal state after March 2019. This would mean that the UK would negotiate with other coastal states such as Norway, Iceland and the EU regarding access to each other’s waters – as opposed to being part of the CFP bloc, as it has been up until now.

EPA/Will Oliver

But the deal means that, rather than becoming an independent coastal state and being able to form its own fisheries policy, the UK’s fishing industry will remain beholden to EU rules.

Small but significant

Fishing makes up a very small proportion of the UK’s GDP (about 0.05%) and is sometimes seen as relatively unimportant compared to other sectors of the economy. But it has huge regional importance in areas such as Cornwall, the north-east of Scotland and Shetland where it represents a significant part of the local economy, as well as the cultural identity of these areas.

The CFP has always been controversial. Although it is hard to say exactly what proportion of fish in UK waters the CFP allows UK vessels to catch relative to other EU vessels, given migratory patterns and so forth, it is somewhere around 30%.

This is the crux of the matter when it comes to the derision that is felt by UK fishermen towards the CFP. The UK fishing industry has been in relative decline for decades and yet UK vessels cannot catch about 70% of stocks in UK waters because of the CFP’s quota system.

Other issues are important too, such as the perceived “top-down” nature of the way that the CFP operates. According to surveys of British fishermen, around 92% of skippers in the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and therefore leave the CFP.

Britain’s relative weakness

The transition deal clearly highlights both the priorities of the UK government and its relative weakness when it comes to negotiations with the EU and the interests of the other 27 member states.

It is easy to see why the EU is reluctant to give up access to UK waters. The territorial waters of the EU (known technically as its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)) expanded hugely when Ireland and the UK joined the European Community in 1973. Then again when Spain and Portugal, both of which have large fishing fleets, joined a decade later.

So there is little wonder that the idea of the UK leaving the CFP is of concern to a number of member states. According to reports, France was particularly adamant that any moves to restrict access to UK waters after March 2019 would result in restrictions on UK access to EU markets in other sectors.

The UK’s inability to set the agenda for much of the Brexit negotiations had left the door open for the EU to put a quid pro quo on the table. Essentially, it said the UK can have tariff-free access to EU markets for reciprocal access to fishing waters. Given the UK government’s desire to secure a good deal with the EU and prevent a “cliff-edge” Brexit, the needs of the wider economy ultimately prevailed.

Managing expectations

The idea that the EU would cede control over fisheries in full after March 2019 was always unlikely. In hindsight the government made an error in promising what ultimately could not be delivered to the catching sector.

Giving firm commitments on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations is a flawed strategy, given that any single issue or economic sector cannot be separated from the overall deal. Plus, any successful post-Brexit fisheries policy will require the cooperation of the fishing industry – reneging on an undeliverable promise isn’t a good start to building a strong working relationship.

Electorally, the Conservatives did well in a number of coastal constituencies in the 2017 election, winning back seats such as Banff and Buchan in Scotland which they lost to the SNP in 1987. The transition deal diminishes their credibility when standing up for fishing communities in these areas.

It is not clear, however, which political party stands to profit from this. In Scotland, the SNP supports EU membership and, by extension, would have to accept the CFP – despite advocating scrapping or fundamentally reforming the policy. In England, UKIP would be the obvious alternative for those disgruntled by the CFP, but UKIP does not pose a significant threat at the moment given its internal troubles and collapse since the last election.

The transition deal always had an air of inevitability about it. Despite all the promises made by government ministers, the impact that fishing has on the UK’s GDP relative to other member states has meant that it was always likely to be a card that could be traded off for a better deal elsewhere.

As for the ultimate end goal for the UK government on fisheries, independent coastal state status will come the UK’s way eventually. It is just not going to be as quickly as some would have hoped.

The government should be wary of making further promises to the fishing industry which cannot be guaranteed. The terms and conditions that the UK accepts for the relationship with the EU after the transition period may represent further disappointment for the UK fishing industry.

After Greenland voted to leave the European Economic Community in 1982, it spent three years negotiating its exit and had to settle for very little change in access rights to its fisheries for European vessels. This example suggests that UK fishermen may yet be in store for more disappointment down the line."

Our research on the likely economic consequences of leaving the European Union on different regions and industries is consistent with the recently leaked government analysis which suggests that London will be one of the areas least hit in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The north-east of England, meanwhile, will be one of the worst affected.

An important element here is that these regions (and the sectors of the economy based there) have little representation in the Brexit negotiations and rarely figure in media discussions. When it comes to the potential impact of Brexit, the most prominent stories are those with underlying political or business interests. For example, the case for special treatment of particular industries after Brexit tends to revolve around financial services, automobile and aerospace firms.

On the one hand this is because these industries are widely understood as critical for the UK economy. But it’s worth noting that these industries also have strong lobbying power and access to government policymakers. In contrast, many other parts of the UK economy do not. Our analysis suggests that, in reality, it is many of the less high-profile sectors – and the regions where they are located – that could be the most exposed to Brexit.

We examined the extent to which British industries depend on trade with the EU. On the basis of an analysis of global trade patterns across 43 countries and 54 industries, we were able to calculate a Brexit risk-exposure index.

We did this for each UK sector under a “no deal” Brexit scenario in which much of UK trade faces severe disruptions and impediments. We also put together a “hyper-competitive” scenario in which UK industries can rapidly adapt and mitigate against the effects of losing single market access.

In our analysis, an industry’s exposure to Brexit is defined by the extent it is dependent on products or services that cross a UK-EU border at least once. We calculated exposure levels for different industries. They indicate how much the industry has to restructure its supply chains and employees to mitigate against the losses caused by reduced post-Brexit trade and movement with the EU. This gives us a picture of which industries are likely to be hit hardest by a no-deal Brexit and which ones will most likely remain virtually unaffected.

Deal or no deal

Across the UK, the results for a no-deal Brexit scenario show:

More than 2.5m jobs are directly at risk.

Almost £140 billion of UK economic activity annually is directly at risk.

Many important manufacturing and primary industries are at risk, but so are many service industries – not just financial services.

Many of these services are not only exported directly to EU countries, but are also sold to UK manufacturing firms who then export to the EU.

Workers in the jobs at risk are on average slightly more productive than the average British worker – so Brexit is likely to exacerbate the UK’s productivity problems.

The findings show that in 15 out of 54 industries, more than 20% (and up to 36%) of economic activity is at risk from Brexit. Industries include fisheries, chemicals and motor vehicle manufacturing.

The industries facing the highest risks overall, and likely to be the hardest hit by a no-deal Brexit, are service industries such as professional, scientific, administrative and technical services. Others at high risk include the wholesale trades, legal and accounting services, retail trade, warehousing, land transport services, computer programming, and activities that support financial services. These are all industries which are dissipated across the wider economy and have very little structured lobbying power or media profiles.

Alternatively, in a “hyper-competitive scenario” – where UK industries can rapidly adjust to life outside the single market by sourcing parts in the UK that are currently sourced from the EU – our findings suggest that increases in UK employment and GDP could be about one-third of the losses in a no-deal scenario. So the risks for the UK would be much less in this scenario.

But current UK productivity figures suggest that most of the UK economy is nowhere near being hyper-competitive, so this case appears to be largely unrealistic.

Sector and region inequality

Our research also found that financial services is one of the least vulnerable sectors to Brexit with an exposure level of 8% of its GDP being at risk. This is still significant, but it is low in comparison to many other sectors – largely because the financial services sector is already highly globalised and therefore displays a low dependence on EU markets.

Instead of financial services, greater emphasis should be placed on helping other, much more exposed sectors. Those that are likely to be the hardest hit by a no-deal Brexit are a range of other services industries. But these are parts of the economy which don’t lobby Westminster and rarely get the attention they need.

Our other analyses also show that it is the Midlands and the North of England which are by far the most vulnerable. They are more exposed to Brexit than any other region in Europe. The reason is that the Midlands and north of England are much more dependent on EU markets for their trade than London, the South-East or Scotland.

As such, in the UK-EU negotiations there is no real representation from either the most exposed sectors or the most exposed regions. Instead, the focus of government discussions tends to be on those sectors and regions which are actually the least exposed parts of the UK economy. This means that whatever is finally negotiated is unlikely to alleviate the effects of Brexit on the vast majority of the UK.

It was during the period of large-scale evictions that landlord-led economic intervention ended and chronic depopulation began.
By 1951, the Highlands had a population of only 309,000 and one of the highest unemployment rates in Britain.
Thanks to the EU, what was once considered to be a problem is now a model of economic success for similar developing regions.","economic, reverse, eu, land, period, scotlands, brexit, population, islands, highland, highlands, local, model, region, turned, opportunities, success","Perched on the furthest, wildest reaches of northern Britain, the Highlands and Islands of Scotland have historically been perceived as more economically backward than the rest of the country.

Framed as the “Highland problem” by policymakers, this stereotype led to the view that the north and west of Scotland was destined to remain in a state of underdevelopment. Despite a long history of economic intervention intended to ease poverty and build wealth in the region, it wasn’t until the 1980s that continued economic assistance and, more recently, migration from the European Union caused the population of the Highlands and Islands to grow significantly.

This recent economic success has largely been the result of the injection of significant EU funds, and a willingness to use local knowledge and collaborate with local agencies.

A bleak history

Chronic population loss in the Highlands has traditionally been blamed on the era of estate restructuring, known as the Improvement Era (around 1750-1850). During this period, many landlords were keen to displace their tenants from fertile valleys to the margins of their estates to make way for livestock, leaving many Highlanders without their traditional land base.

Some people were evicted in this early period of the Highland Clearances, but many left of their own accord in search of opportunities elsewhere. They did so for a variety of reasons, such as looking for seasonal work in factories in the rapidly industrialising Lowlands or leaving in search of land and opportunities in North America.

Though many people – up to 23-25,000 people between 1760 and 1815 alone – left during this period, the population actually rose overall from 266,000 to around 420,000 due to a relative rise in the standard of living and the widespread reliance on successful cultivation of the potato, which helped sustain families on small crofts.

Yet social commentators like Samuel Johnson gave the public the impression that there was an “epidemical fury of emigration”. In fact, there were efforts in this period by optimistic landlords to end poverty and prevent emigration through the provision of employment and infrastructure using private and government funds.

This led, for example, to the formation of the British Fisheries Society in the late 18th century, which laid the foundations for later success in the herring industry, and saw massive expansion of roads, bridges and canals.

But change did not come soon enough. When the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, the economy of the Highlands collapsed. Britain’s war machine was the major market for the limited number of Highland products and employment (in this case, soldiers), and with its loss, the area plunged into economic despair and famine. Thousands of people were either evicted or emigrated. It was during the period of large-scale evictions that landlord-led economic intervention ended and chronic depopulation began.

By 1951, the Highlands had a population of only 309,000 and one of the highest unemployment rates in Britain. This caused Picture Post magazine to declare in 1953 that this was “Britain’s most gravely depressed area”.

Though intermittent government intervention from the late 19th century to the post-World War II period – such as the Crofter’s Act of 1886, various land settlement acts and the formation of the Highlands and Islands Development Board in 1965 – may have increased access to land and bolstered salmon farming, energy and tourism, it was unable to stem population loss in the region, especially that of young people seeking opportunities elsewhere.

Boom time

But all this changed in the 1980s when the EU targeted the area for transitional support funding, designed to boost the economic prospects of an area “lagging behind”. Since then, sustained and customised assistance from the EU has led to huge advances in economic development, bringing unprecedented wealth to the region as innovative local industries, and in particular small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), have benefited from that support.

In particular, transport (roads and ferries), culture, biotech, tourism, life sciences, food and drink, financial and business services, resource extraction and energy investment have flourished through local partnerships and the transfer of local knowledge to international markets.

Most notable was the EU’s support for the creation of the University of the Highlands and Islands in 2011, thanks to European funds invested in IT, research development, course development and delivery, and widening access to more remote communities.

As a result, there has been significant population growth and retention in recent years, especially of young people who, in former times, left in large numbers for universities and jobs in the south or abroad.

Forward or backward?

EU citizens migrating to the Highlands to fill the growing number of jobs in the region have boosted its population and its economy; in recent years, 62% of migrant workers to the Highlands have come from the EU.

In 2011, the population of the Highlands was 466,112 – the highest ever recorded – a figure that, at the current rate of increase was expected to rise to about half a million by around 2031. But with the announcement of Brexit in 2015, this is looking less certain. With 23% of small businesses currently employing EU nationals, there are fears over recruitment issues in the future.

Thanks to the EU, what was once considered to be a problem is now a model of economic success for similar developing regions. With Brexit on the horizon, an area enjoying some of the fastest growth in the UK is being directly threatened by the inevitable end to EU investment which will run out in 2020.

As the Highland region is still considered “transitional” by the EU, and therefore in need of support, it will rely heavily on the UK government’s pledge to continue “projects currently funded by the EU”.

It remains to be seen whether or not the UK government will invest in the future of the Highlands to the level the EU has done. If it doesn’t, it seems likely that many will leave in search of opportunities elsewhere – a scenario with a long and regrettable history in the Highlands."

With the prospect of no longer being part of an EU member state and perpetually questioning its place in the United Kingdom, Scotland is now seeking to define itself as a “Northern” nation.

Definitions of the Arctic and the North are becoming increasingly blurred. That, in turn, affects debates about who gets a say in regional politics. Non-Arctic states, such as France and Germany, and supranational actors, like the European Union, argue that they are affected by regional developments in the North and should have a say in what is happening there. They want to help protect the Arctic environment but they are also interested in potentially capitalising the results of climate change. Mainly, as the region opens up, its resources and waterways present new economic opportunities.

One arena for regional discussion is the Arctic Circle. According to its website, this is “the largest network of international dialogue and cooperation on the future of the Arctic”. Partners include states, sub-states, IGOs and NGOs from around the world.

At the Arctic Circle’s latest meeting in Edinburgh, many of the speeches and maps shown suggested that Scotland is in the North. Sometimes, however, North and Arctic were conflated by presenters. This made Scotland seem more Arctic than it is, which was emphasised repeatedly by delegates talking about Scotland’s links and proximity to Iceland.

The Arctic Council, meanwhile, is the most recognisable and established Arctic forum. It has a stricter set of parameters defining the Arctic states and how other actors (the non-Arctic states, NGOs, and IGOs) can participate. It is focused on environmental protection and sustainable development under the leadership of the eight recognised Arctic states – Canada; the Kingdom of Denmark (Denmark, Greenland, Faroe Islands); Finland; Iceland; Norway; the Russian Federation; Sweden; and the United States. It has generated reports, such as on the environmental impact of climate change and global warming and biodiversity, and has facilitated the development of three regionally focused legally binding agreements.

Scotia north star

Scotland is a recent addition to the crowd seeking a role up north. The Scottish government is seeking to promote the nation’s northern-ness, capitalising on the malleable meanings of the words “Arctic” and “North”.

It is not that far fetched to think of Scotland as being in the North. It is the northernmost place in the United Kingdom and borders the North Sea. It also plays a strategic role in the search and rescue coverage of the Faroe Islands. The United Kingdom provides these services, based in Scotland, in partnership with Iceland and Denmark. As such, Scotland has close links with some Arctic states.

While there is no set international definition of the North and Arctic, they are not exactly the same place. Norway, for example, makes a point of distinguishing between its North and its High North, as well as the Arctic on occasion.

Scotland lacks recognition as either being part of the Arctic or High North. Crucially, it is not a member of the Arctic Council, although the United Kingdom is an observer state.

A northern future

But the Scottish National party-led government is planning for a future in a post-Brexit and possibly post-independence political landscape. The Arctic and the North are part of this plan. “Scotland – as a close neighbour of the Arctic states … has a key interest in developments in the High North … [T]he Scottish government is committed to continuing to explore ways to deepen our engagement on Arctic issues and enhance our relationships with the Arctic states,” a recent paper stated.

PA

Alasdair Allan, Scotland’s minister for international development and Europe, made the intention clear: “From our location in the north-west corner of the continent, we have always looked outwards building strong cultural, economic and social links with our neighbours across the continent.”

Allan noted the role of Brexit in Scotland’s northern focus, stating that it “voted overwhelmingly by 62% to 38% in favour of remaining” in the EU and will work to build links with Europe regardless of Brexit.

Scotland, like France, Germany and the EU more broadly, wants a greater say in Arctic politics. Environmental issues are hitting the region hard, particularly with decreasing ice thickness and coverage. These changes are impacting global temperatures and sea levels. With Brexit looming and independence from the UK still a possibility, however, economic possibilities in the Arctic and the North are the main draw for Scotland. As a result, it is a great time to be seen as a northern nation, and the Scottish government is striving to brand its country accordingly."

I caught up with him by Skype in New York, where he was attending the UN meetings on development.

Now a member of the House of Lords, he is a veteran of the devolution campaigns of the 1990s and a strong European. As first minister, he was a leader of the movement for a stronger role for devolved regions and nations in the EU. What, I asked him, went wrong with last year’s Brexit referendum?

The problem, he tells me, was an absence of a vision for Europe. The Remain side could not explain where Europe was going, or the need for a broader solidarity. Instead, they focused narrowly on economic issues like the importance of the single market and on negative campaigning. David Cameron “had nothing positive to say”, repeating the mistake he made in the Scottish referendum of 2014 that helped bring the No side to the brink of defeat.

Nonetheless, McConnell believes the Brexit battle is over and sees little prospect of reversing the decision. He calls the country’s departure from the European Union “pretty inevitable”. Nor is he impressed by the current focus on the UK keeping the single market or something very close to it – recently floated by the likes of Chancellor Philip Hammond, for instance.

Future of Europe

Both inside the UK and elsewhere in Europe, McConnell detects a tendency to see the single market as an end in itself. He believes it needs to be part of a bigger picture. Instead of focusing on the technicalities of the single market, Europe needs a broader vision based on solidarity and the whole of the European continent. Instead of focusing narrowly on economics, it could take in a wider agenda, including security threats, climate change and values.

Even though the UK is leaving the EU, he thinks it could still take the lead in these respects by forging links and shifting public opinion. That, of course, would require some rethinking in the UK parties, including his own Labour party. The present Labour leadership under Jeremy Corbyn, he says, shows more interest in revolutionary movements around the world than in the future of Europe.

This overarching failure by politicians in Europe to focus on what the continent could become was one of McConnell’s main themes in a speech he recently gave in Glasgow at the International Conference of Europeanists. Focusing on the growing gap between politicians and the public, he talked about the role this played in the crisis in Europe and Brexit – as well as in the arrival of “outsiders” as leaders.

He urged a greater role for Europe in global poverty and development, a matter he pursued as first minister and to which he has devoted a lot of time in the House of Lords. Europeans can “help rekindle our own sense of purpose”, he told the audience, by sharing with other countries their experiences in power-sharing in areas with distinct identities within countries such as Scotland, Bavaria and the Basque country.

Little Britain

In the run-up to the Brexit referendum, McConnell tells me that he was not optimistic about the Remain campaign. He had predicted Leave’s victory and Scotland’s decision to Remain. What took him more by surprise was the result’s failure to reinvigorate the Scottish independence movement – he had expected it to become unstoppable.

In fact, he says, Brexit has made it harder for the SNP to win the argument: an independent Scotland in the EU risks being cut off from the UK market, which is more important for Scotland than the European single market. He also believes the public is wary of further change and uncertainty after two difficult referendums.

Instead, he says, Brexit provides an opportunity for securing more devolution for Scotland. Powers should come directly back from Brussels to Edinburgh – contrary to the proposals in the Withdrawal Bill published shortly before we spoke.

If powers were repatriated to the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, he believes this would allow them a more equal relationship with the UK government. Edinburgh could share powers in areas like fishing on a voluntary basis, for example, rather than by imposition from London.

McConnell also sees possibilities for Scotland to be more active on the world stage, something he considers neglected in ten years of an SNP government focused on independence. The paradiplomatic activity that he spearheaded as first minister was, he insists, a way of reinforcing the UK by recognising its plurality. He says it reflected the party’s commitment to “shared sovereignty, multilateralism and international cooperation”.

McConnnell’s vision of the UK accords with recent thinking in Scottish Labour circles. This includes Gordon Brown’s interventions and the adoption of federalism as official Labour policy, at Scottish if not UK level.

As the post-referendum research in the Centre on Constitutional Change has shown, it also chimes with public opinion, which has consistently wanted something less than independence but more than devolution. Even as opinion seemingly shifted away from No and towards Yes during the 2014 independence campaign, the underlying attitudes remained rather stable. It is just that more people thought that voting Yes was the better way to get there.

The question is whether Labour has arrived here too late as political opinion has polarised between the SNP’s independence and the Conservatives’ increasingly intransigent unionism, a polarisation accentuated by Brexit. The current disarray of the UK government and the lack of a majority at Westminster may open up some of these issues. If it does, it is not clear that the opposition parties are in a position to seize the opportunity.

Faced with this question, McConnell returns to the theme of vision and big ideas. He sees a need for a renewal of the political class, away from the professional politicians who have come to prominence since the 1970s, for whom politics is a way of life.

He agrees that Jeremy Corbyn has raised horizons, although not as much as has been claimed. Corbyn has showed a willingness to “stand up for ordinary people” and criticise the behaviour of private companies as well as government. On the other hand, says McConnell, he can be seen as part of a trend towards celebrity politicians and outsiders; a symptom of the current crisis rather than an answer.

In short, McConnell sees good and bad in the current climate: he welcomes the decline of the old deference and the growth of transparency but believes it has been accompanied by a crisis of faith in institutions and a loss of trust. There have been achievements in global development but severe poverty remains. Again and again, he stresses the role of ideas and vision in helping to turn this around. In a world that is increasingly voting against technocrats, the message is that ideas really do matter after all."

Nicola Sturgeon, first minister of Scotland and Carwyn Jones, first minister of Wales, in a joint statement published in reaction to the publication of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill on July 13, formerly known as the “Great Repeal Bill”.

Despite Scottish and Welsh dismay at the draft text of the repeal bill, as a matter of law, the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales cannot block the passage of the bill by withholding their consent.

The bill would allow Westminster to convert EU law into UK domestic law in the UK. But the devolution legislation is unambiguous: the conferral of law making powers to Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast “does not affect” the power of the parliament of the UK to make laws for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

So even if one of the devolved legislatures were to withhold consent, the Westminster parliament could still enact the bill.

The question of the devolved legislatures’ consent arises because of the “Sewel convention” – a political rather than a legal rule – whereby the UK parliament will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the devolved legislatures. The convention takes its name from Lord Sewel, former minister of state in the Scottish Office, who “announced” the convention during the parliamentary debates on the Scotland Bill in 1998.

After Scotland’s 2014 independence referendum, the Sewel convention was put on a statutory footing in Scotland and later Wales. It has not been put on a statutory footing in Northern Ireland.

In the case brought by Gina Miller in 2016 over whether the government or parliament had the power to trigger Article 50 to begin the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, the UK Supreme Court held that this statutory recognition did not signify any change in the convention’s status. Its application is therefore a matter for the political process rather than the courts.

Ben Birchall/PA Wire

The UK government accepts that the Sewel convention applies to the repeal bill. In all such cases, the convention has been scrupulously observed by successive UK governments since devolution almost 20 years ago. Although the UK government could in theory disregard it by pushing through the bill without Scottish and Welsh legislative consent, it is unlikely to want to do so as it would lay itself open to the charge of acting unconstitutionally. In Scotland, it would also risk strengthening the case for a second independence referendum.

The parliamentary arithmetic in any event points in the same direction. To be able to proceed without the devolved legislatures’ consent, the UK government would need to be confident of a majority in the House of Commons, which cannot currently be guaranteed. The search will therefore be on in the coming weeks for some form of agreement whereby their consent can be secured.

Verdict

The devolved legislatures cannot block the bill but the need for their consent means that they have a considerable degree of leverage – much more so than if Theresa May had secured a landslide majority in the June election. It is likely the devolved nations will seek to exploit this leverage to the full.

Review

Richard Wyn Jones, Professor of Welsh Politics and Director, Wales Governance Centre, University of Cardiff

There are few phrases more over-worked by journalists and commentators than “constitutional crisis”. Nonetheless, the now very real possibility that the devolved legislatures in Cardiff and Edinburgh will refuse to give their consent to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill – the legislation formerly known as the Great Repeal Bill – raises the spectre of a clash between levels of government that may actually deserve the label. As a matter of law, the author is correct that the UK government can simply ignore the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales. But as the piece suggests, the political reality is that doing so would further weaken May’s already enfeebled administration.

Is compromise possible? There is genuine annoyance in both Edinburgh and Cardiff at the way they believe the UK government has failed to engage with their proposals on Brexit in a serious manner. But it’s about more than lack of engagement. Central government, on the one hand, and the devolved governments, on the other, seem to have fundamentally different understandings of what devolution means. It’s hard to imagine how clever re-drafting of the bill alone can bridge the gap between them. With the bill set to be followed by further Brexit-related legislation that will whittle away at the powers of the devolved nations, we are entering a very difficult – and yes, crisis-ridden – period for the state’s territorial constitution.

Like many people, I thought most analysis of the Scottish political landscape post-general election could be expressed before we fully knew the results, so I wrote the bulk of this piece early on, before reflecting on the way things actually played out.

The campaign was dominated by talk of “indyref2” – a second referendum on Scottish independence. As in the elections for Holyrood in 2016, the debate soon became polarised and simplistic. The SNP focused largely on Brexit and the UK Conservative government as symbols of the limited control of Scotland’s destiny held by Scottish voters.

The Conservatives went all out to use the election as a platform for its anti-referendum stance, even to the point of printing placards to protest the SNP’s manifesto launch. Both parties embraced “valence politics” wholeheartedly, focusing on each other’s lack of governing competence (the SNP in Scotland, the Conservatives in the UK), accentuating focus on the leaders, and simplifying their message to the extent that if there was any discussion of actual policies going on, they had failed.

The Conservatives found that this approach helped them regain ground in Scotland: they became obsessive in their declaration that the SNP is obsessed by the prospect of another referendum. There were other parties involved, but you could blink and miss their importance to this election.

The only way was down

The analysis will be dominated by a comparison with 2015, in which the SNP came close to winning all 59 seats (they managed 56, after securing just six in the previous election in 2010). Each seat lost by the SNP in 2017 will be interpreted by the Conservatives as a vote against a second independence referendum.

We faced the bizarre prospect of relatively few newly minted Conservative MPs declaring in their acceptance speeches to a far greater number of SNP MPs, that the people had spoken in the 2017 election: they don’t want another referendum. In fact, the longer-term story remains one of SNP dominance of almost every form of election in Scotland, to the point that opponents declare success if the SNP sees a drop in seats but still wins overall.

When viewed through the lens of the late 1990s when Labour dominated in Scotland, the SNP’s current position is truly remarkable. Perhaps the trick for most opposition parties is to portray the SNP’s 2017 results as a similar beginning of the end, with only another decade or so until it emulates Labour’s spectacular decline.

Yet, if we remain fixated on the constitution and neglect to debate properly the record of the Scottish (and UK) government, why would people vote for anyone except the SNP and, to a lesser extent, the Scottish Conservatives?

How it really played out

As it turned out, this analysis did not quite tell the whole story. The SNP did more than lose a few seats (21 in total, down to 35 from 56 seats in 2015). And even though they remain the largest party and won the election in Scotland, the result will, for some time, feel like a loss or at least a major setback, particularly since they experienced major losses with senior figures Alex Salmond and party deputy leader Angus Robertson.

With 13 seats (a huge increase of 12) that included the scalps of Salmond and Robertson, the Conservatives re-established themselves as Scotland’s main opposition, with every win providing disproportionate symbolic value and a chance to reiterate that their constituents are sick at the thought of another referendum.

Scottish Labour performed a minor miracle gaining seven seats (an increase of six), described before any serious analysis as evidence of a “Corbyn bounce”. Even the Liberal Democrats won back some credibility with four seats (an increase of three). So, in a shifting political landscape, the Scottish electorate helped rewrite a well-worn script.

We will need more reflection to work out the implications for a second referendum on Scottish independence. In the short term, it is clear that Nicola Sturgeon would not have announced one so quickly if she had her time again (although her hand was forced in part by the Brexit vote itself).

The phrase “now is not the time” seems to have more weight after the election, with or without Theresa May behind it. In the longer term, the further maintenance of SNP dominance in most elections will surely keep the issue high up the Scottish agenda, particularly when the implications of Brexit become clearer and start to bite.

But for now, it’s hard to believe that anyone has an appetite for any more voting on any issue."

Days earlier, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, railed against UK government plans to use Brexit to fundamentally undermine devolution, ramping up the threat of a second independence referendum. They were both talking about the same issue.

Sturgeon is right that Brexit presents a serious challenge to current devolution settlements, not only in Scotland but also in Wales and Northern Ireland. The UK and devolved governments are currently positioning themselves for a battle. The reason lies in the fundamental architecture of devolution.

How devolution works

In 1998, three devolution acts dealt out responsibility between the UK and the devolved institutions. The cards it deals are policy areas, which are described in broad terms in the devolution legislation. In Wales, for example, the Welsh National Assembly legislates for, and the Welsh government “owns”, agriculture, culture, the environment, health services and planning (among others) in Wales, just as government departments in Westminster do for England.

Contrary to Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson’s reported remarks, powers exercised in Brussels do not in the first instance return to “the UK”, if by that is meant the UK government. Rather, what the devolved institutions can do with at least some of the cards they were dealt in 1998 will be massively expanded.

In the EU, for instance, farm subsidies are a matter for the Common Agricultural Policy, and there is currently little for the devolved governments to do other than administer it. But it’s clearly part of “agriculture”, a devolved competence, so after Brexit, it will, legally, fall to the devolved countries. The result is that there could be four completely different farm support systems in the UK, which would affect whether there was a single market within the UK for food.

Questions for the UK’s single market

Up until now, the UK has not had to worry about how the internal single market between the four parts of the country was constituted, because they were all part of a larger single market. The devolution settlement was designed and developed under the wing of the EU-wide single market. So the UK government has never had the need for some sort of cross-cutting power to prevent the more general devolved regulatory cards – such as agriculture, fisheries, and environmental protection – undermining the internal single market in the UK.

That Whitehall is thinking about either some cross-cutting power to “safeguard” the UK’s internal single market, or redefining some of the areas currently controlled by Brussels – for example stripping farm subsidies out of control of agriculture – was evident from May’s speech. The now much-repeated mantra that “no decisions currently taken by Holyrood [the Scottish Parliament] will be taken away” implies that decisions currently taken in Brussels can be “taken away”.

Battles ahead

In federal systems, cross-cutting powers often exist. Perhaps the most familiar is the inter-state commerce power, which allows the federal government to “regulate” trade in the US. This commerce power has been an enormously efficient instrument of centralisation.

But, to accomplish its aim of keeping the cross-cutting powers previously exercised by Brussels at the UK level, May’s government will have to legislate to change each of the devolution statutes. If it does, it should need the consent of the devolved legislatures, according to the Sewel convention, a constitutional rule which “normally” requires such consent – although there may be yet another constitutional argument about what it covers. In any case, at least in Scotland and probably Wales, the politics of the devolved administrations means there is unlikely to be consent to such a change.

The UK is not a federal state and May’s government is not merely a higher-tier authority which can monitor disputes between equal, federal substate entities. It may exercise upper-tier type functions over the immigration, national defence and the currency in relation to the devolved nations, but it is also the government for England, the overwhelmingly dominant part of the UK. So when it comes to farm subsidies or environmental protection, the UK government is not merely the upper-tier: it is the government of England, and – the suspicion will be – it will act in England’s interest.

The stage is set for a Brexit-inspired constitutional confrontation between the devolved administrations and the UK government – and it’s the UK government that has to make the first move."

This was an important reminder of the significant implications leaving the EU holds for the UK’s current devolved system of government.

Brexit will not just affect the UK’s current devolution arrangements, it will also potentially impact on the nation’s external affairs in areas such as energy, the environment and international trade.

So when the government vows to “deliver an outcome that works for the whole of the UK” after Brexit, it needs to consider the specific interests of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each voted differently in the referendum and as the UK seeks to leave the EU, each will have its own interests. Brexit is truly a two-union issue.

In the years since it joined the European Economic Community in 1973, the UK has embarked on a project to devolve political power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Various legislative powers have moved from Westminster to the devolved governments and parliaments, with different arrangements for each.

Many of these competences, such as agriculture and environmental policy, were devolved in part because they are predominantly legislated and enforced at the EU level anyway. With the UK set to leave the EU it is not clear what will happen when these competences are repatriated from the EU and to what extent they will be given directly to the devolved administrations.

The UK government also needs to undertake a review of which EU competences are to be returned to the devolved administrations under current constitutional arrangements. The UK’s current devolution settlement was reached after the UK joined the EU in 1973 so, when powers are repatriated from the EU to the UK, there needs to be a decision on which powers will then be devolved.

Working together

Even before any of this happens, the UK will need a joint position on what each constituent part wants from Brexit – which has so far proved a daunting task.

A joint ministerial committee has been established as a forum for the various UK leaders to talk about Brexit. But this is an inadequate mechanism. As well as deciding how to negotiate Brexit, this group also needs to represent UK-wide interests afterwards, as the future relationship with Europe takes shape.

Then there is the matter of external affairs. In the past few decades, the division between domestic and foreign policy has become increasingly blurred. While foreign policy remains reserved for the UK government, some policy areas with external dimensions have been devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These include agriculture, fisheries and the environment – areas of significance for the UK in developing a post-EU external trade and commercial policy.

PA/David Cheskin

Prior to the referendum, the devolved administrations had already sought to establish – to differing degrees – their own profiles in external affairs. Scotland is already well advanced in this respect. It has a relatively strong presence in Brussels and elsewhere to represent its international interests and preferences on matters such as the single market, free movement of people and fishing.

The outcome of the referendum has given these efforts renewed impetus. This could mean that the UK will show a more multifaceted profile to the EU, its member states and third countries after Brexit.

It would be sensible for the devolved administrations to develop their existing arrangements for representing their interests directly to the EU and member states after Brexit. Wales currently has a less extensive set of arrangements in place than Scotland and Northern Ireland’s system of government poses particular challenges to developing a coherent external relations, given the delicate balance of power between the two ruling parties.

Devolution ensures that the landscape of the UK’s external affairs looks set to be more variegated and complicated after it exits the EU."

On the plus side, it means there will now be a Westminster vote over triggering Brexit. On the minus side, there will be no veto for Scotland or the other devolved parliaments. Yet this too is arguably a positive in the Scottish government’s quest to keep Scotland in the EU and eventually gain independence.

The court’s decision to allow both houses of parliament to vote on the Brexit bill will help the Scottish nationalist MPs at Westminster as they try to build support for avoiding a departure from the European single market. It will also cause difficulties particularly for Labour, which is already torn between having many MPs who oppose Brexit but serve constituencies that voted in favour.

Still the SNP’s main competitor for votes in Scotland, Labour’s intractable mess over Brexit will become much more obvious in debates and votes in the House of Commons. This will help to sharpen political conflict over the process and substance of Brexit, which sees the SNP aligned with Scottish voters and many of the country’s institutions and interest groups – a fairly novel situation for the party on a major constitutional, political and economic issue.

Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and Scottish first minister, has already said her party will table 50 “serious and substantive amendments” to the bill. These will include a proposal that the UK would remain in the EU under revised membership terms if MPs reject the final deal; and that any deal will require the unanimous agreement of the Joint Ministerial Committee of the UK’s four nations.

No veto

The Supreme Court’s decision against allowing the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments to have a formal role in the Brexit process is a mixed blessing for the SNP. The Scottish government would have used its institutional leverage to bargain, negotiate and threaten the UK with a veto – not least as it has produced its own Brexit options for Scotland. Now the Scottish government is reduced to making political hay by moving for a Brexit vote in Holyrood anyway.

On the other hand, the Supreme Court ruling relegated the importance of devolution and supports the supremacy of Westminster. The 55% No vote in the Scottish independence referendum of 2014 was built on a strong and improved devolution settlement and the argument that UK membership was the only way to stay in the EU: both have been fatally undermined by Brexit.

It’s a funny kind of unionism that prevents Scotland (and the other devolved nations) from having a voice over Brexit through institutions set up to bolster their role in the UK. The Conservative government’s position isn’t exactly consistent with claims from senior figures to “listen to Scotland” and that the UK is a “partnership of nations”. It doesn’t make Scotland appear to have “the strongest devolved parliament in the world”, contrary to promises from former prime minister David Cameron.

Poll position

Where does this all leave a second independence referendum? Following the court’s verdict, Nicola Sturgeon did not really move forward from her previous indications that a referendum is probable. She said:

Is Scotland content for our future to be dictated by an increasingly right-wing Westminster government with just one MP here – or is it better that we take our future into our own hands? It is becoming ever clearer that this is a choice that Scotland must make.

My own reading is that the court’s decision probably makes a second referendum closer. Crucially, however, there will be less control over the timing than last time around. When the Scottish government negotiated the terms of the first independence referendum in 2012, it was given the power to hold it by the end of 2014. This gave it some control over the timetable. This time, the timing of such a poll will probably be dictated by the Brexit departure timetable.

And while Brexit is certainly the type of explicit material change the SNP has long said would legitimise a second referendum, this doesn’t make it inevitable or winnable. There are a lot of obstacles in the way, such as the oil price, the currency question, future EU membership and lukewarm independence polling.

The SNP leadership is realistic about this, retaining a note of caution, knowing that everything is different to 2014 except public opinion. Yet much could still change: a lot of the substance of Brexit and its effects are still to come. That will feed into the SNP’s agenda on the constitution – not to mention policy issues for the Scottish government such as EU citizens, social policy, the environment, single market, energy and higher education. As Nicola Sturgeon and her advisers await the UK goverment’s White Paper on Brexit, they will certainly be feeling that there is still everything to play for."

Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, had previously indicated there would be another referendum unless either the UK or Scotland could stay in the European single market, and neither now looks possible.

In an interview after May’s speech, Sturgeon agreed it was “all but inevitable” that a second referendum would now take place, and that the plan to leave the single market brought it “undoubtedly closer”. Despite some reports that lukewarm polling is making certain nationalists wary of another referendum, other campaigners have speculated it could come early next year – or after Brexit is completed a couple of years down the line.

If Scotland is now heading for another referendum in the near future, the question for the Yes side is how best to proceed. Last time, arguments like the economic fallout and losing the pound helped deliver a 55% victory for the No side – thanks in particular to older voters. To overturn this, psychologists like myself would advise Sturgeon and her colleagues to study the political upsets of 2016. That means the Brexit victory, plus another unexpected result currently bearing fruit – the election of soon-to-be President Donald Trump.

Decisions, decisions

Both results can be explained by psychological research into decision-making and voters’ biases. We know that for complex and emotional decisions, people tend to be led by intuition rather than weighing the available evidence – intuitive decision making is guided by cognitive rule of thumb techniques called heuristics. Elections and referendums are very much in this category, but few more so than Brexit and Trump.

Immigration is a very emotive topic and featured heavily in both debates. Both were also complicated by contradictory information plus scandals in the case of the presidential election and, in the case of the EU referendum, a subject few people really understand. Voters probably relied heavily on their intuition in both cases.

This will have been driven by certain classic heuristics, such as “take the best”. When voters are making a choice between two outcomes, they compare these against a small number of cues from campaigners such as slogans, suggested policies and so forth. One obvious cue was “making America/Britain great again”, for example. In the case of Brexit, others included things like “do you want control over your borders?” and “leaving the EU will free up money for the NHS”.

Voters rank cues from both sides from most to least valid, and choose their side based on the first piece of information that allows them to favour one outcome over the other. In the EU referendum, for example, voters seem to have processed the “take back control” cue and this enabled them to decide to vote Brexit. Thus the decision was made without evaluating all the available evidence.

When indviduals reach a decision, they often get into a mindset where they will disregard conflicting information and see confirming information as being very positive. This is known as confirmation bias, and you’ll see it particularly on social media during any emotive election.

We saw it in the EU referendum when pro-Brexit voters reacted to expert advice that leaving the EU might damage the UK’s economy by apparently agreeing with Leave campaigner Michael Gove’s claim that they had had enough of experts. This allowed them to confirm their pre-decisional choice and disregard contradictory information, protecting their intuitive decision from appeals to reason.

But why did this process lead voters to choose Brexit and Trump? The human mind doesn’t have much cognitive capacity so it avoids wasting time unnecessarily. As a result, intuitive decision-making favours information that is simple. Politicians who are masters of simplistic messages and continually repeat words will be favoured – last year, Trump and the British Leave campaign did better in this regard.

Lessons for Yes Scotland

The lesson for a future Yes Scotland campaign is that it needs to create an emotive argument around independence, since this will promote an environment more conducive to voters relying on intuition. For instance, the campaign could focus on arguments such as “Britain dragged us out of Europe” and “decisions made south of the border have had a negative impact on Scotland’s economy”.

In many ways, this would amount to mirroring the No campaign of 2014. The No campaign was arguably blessed with the best emotive “cards” last time, such as the economy and the EU, which encouraged voters looking for short-cuts to the “right” choice to favour it. Now those cards may well be in the hands of the Yes side. At the same time, it might want to play to certain emotive strengths it chose to play down last time, such as Scotland’s culture and history.

The Yes side will also need to appeal to the intuition of the electorate by using simplistic language, promoting simple cues that allow independence to be favoured over the status quo. An example would be pushing a message that Scotland has no voice in the UK, using Brexit as the prime exhibit. Sturgeon already demonstrated an ability to do this when the SNP won almost every seat in Scotland in the 2015 UK election by driving home the failings of the Westminster parties.

If the Yes campaign seizes the initiative with the right messaging early and gets some luck along the way, confirmation bias will also set in. Then pro-independence statistics and information would be seen as very positive by many voters while messages from the other side would get disregarded or skewed to suit the Yes side’s agenda.

The 2016 victors have demonstrated how to win a political campaign when the opinion polls are against you. In particular, it will be the ultimate irony if Sturgeon and her fellow campaigners end up winning Scottish independence having learned from the unionist Brexiteers how to cross the finishing line."

By imposing this limit on the Brexit negotiations, parliament may remove a key red line on the government’s side and widen its room for negotiation.","trade, services, strategy, single, uk, eu, britain, agreement, brexit, market, parliaments, uks, negotiations, unite, deal","Nearly six months after the UK’s vote to leave the EU, the path to Brexit is still uncharted. All we know is that because the UK government wants to maximise single market access without accepting the free movement of people, it is looking for a different arrangement to any that currently exists.

Representatives of the EU institutions and the other 27 member states have rejected the idea of a bespoke free-trade agreement with the UK. They argue that the single market is defined by the four freedoms – free movement of goods, capital, services and people – and that they cannot be unpicked.

They also argue, quite correctly, that no country can have full unfettered access to the EU single market without also agreeing to abide by a single set of rules governing that market. With multiple red lines on both sides, the margins for negotiation seem very limited.

What the UK should do

I have argued elsewhere that the UK should seek to remain in the single market by joining the European Economic Area (EEA) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which incorporate Norway, Switzerland, Liechenstein and Iceland. This would be subject to agreement by EFTA and the EU.

My reasoning is that the costs of leaving the EU will be considerable – cutting 1.8% to 7.8% from annual GDP by 2030 depending on the trade deal, according to independent analysts. Some counter that there is no evidence of such economic dislocation in the British economy but they are missing the point. We will only experience lower trade, investment and GDP growth after we leave the EU.

The current sterling depreciation is the financial markets’ closest estimate of the damage to come. Remaining in the single market through the EEA/EFTA while negotiating free-trade deals with non-EU countries is the UK’s second best option. And in an era where isolationism in trade looks set to be increasing following the victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election, the last thing you want is to be outside a major trade bloc.

The UK government may prefer a better deal than EEA/EFTA membership, for example by remaining in the EU’s customs union, since it imposes single EU tariffs on all outside countries and would therefore keep UK trade much simpler. But it is difficult to see how the UK can achieve what it wishes within the two-year time limit for negotiations after Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is triggered – due by the end of March.

With the UK in a very weak bargaining position, EEA/EFTA membership would be a “truce position” that would ensure an arrangement was in place within the two years. Remaining in the single market through EEA/EFTA but outside the customs union would also increase its margin for negotiation with non-EU countries – as Norway has done.

Alternatives

There have been indications that the UK is trying to chart an alternative Brexit course. It may want to reach an agreement with the EU on tariff-free trade as a transitional arrangement while leaving the single market, for example. The obvious problem is this would not allow the UK to overcome potential non-tariff barriers to the EU, such as the “passporting rights” that allow financial services companies to operate across the union from a single country.

Such an arrangement also runs the risk of falling foul of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on free-trade deals, unless it were seen as an interim agreement leading to a more comprehensive deal within ten years. This would require an agreement to that effect with the EU, which adds a level of complication.

A variation is that the UK could pursue a “sector-by-sector” deal that goes beyond tariffs to retain full trading privileges for priority sectors – financial services and motor manufacture for example. The problem is that the EU would want concessions in return, for example in agriculture and fisheries. The UK would have to favour some sectors at the expense of others, which wouldn’t be popular, particularly as the vote to leave was particularly strong in the sectors the EU would want to protect.

The EU might also demand other concessions such as requiring the UK to contribute to the EU budget, as Switzerland has to, or to compromise on freedom of movement. A sector-by-sector deal also seems to flout WTO rules that in free-trade agreements, the two sides’ duties and restrictive regulations have to be eliminated on “substantially all the trade” between them.

The devolved dimension

The Brexit negotiations also involve an important intra-UK dimension. Two of the UK’s constituent nations, Scotland and Northern Ireland, voted to Remain, as did London, whose economy depends critically on financial and other services exports to the EU. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has argued forcefully that in the absence of a commitment to keep the whole of the UK in the single market her government will seek to explore ways of implementing an alternative plan for Scotland to protect its interests: what has been dubbed a “flexible Brexit”.

The EU and EEA certainly already display a number of legal models which have been developed over time to deal with different territories’ specific needs. The situation of Northern Ireland will also require the exploration of a bespoke solution as it seeks to maintain free movement across the Irish border as per the Good Friday agreement.

The question remains whether the UK as the member state will choose to agree to build in these intra-UK dimensions to the Brexit negotiations. The UK has so far provided little insight as to its strategy, albeit Theresa May, the UK prime minister, has said publicly there will be no Brexit opt-outs.

One irony is that if early next year the UK Supreme Court upholds the recent High Court decision that there must be a parliamentary vote ahead of triggering Article 50, it might actually strengthen the government’s hand. Suppose parliament stipulated it would only authorise triggering Article 50 if the government didn’t negotiate anything which imperilled full unfettered access to the single market, for example.

By imposing this limit on the Brexit negotiations, parliament may remove a key red line on the government’s side and widen its room for negotiation. This would also bring the UK government closer to the positions of the devolved administrations in their pursuit of single market participation and freedom of movement.

May has pledged to advance a single UK position when negotiations with the EU begin next year. This pledge could be interpreted in either of two ways. She could be attempting to compel the nations of the UK to conform to the Westminster government’s Brexit position, or she could be opening the door to other positions in the hope of destabilising the moves towards leaving the EU. The former is the most likely, however May cannot be seen to be overtly imposing the will of the Brexiteers on the devolved institutions without risking political consequences.

In the case of Scotland such consequences are well advertised. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants to at least keep Scotland in the single market and, really, her ultimate goal is to stay in the EU. The Scottish people voted to remain, which Sturgeon is interpreting as a solid mandate to oppose moves in London to take Scotland out.

Similarly, Northern Ireland voted to remain. The deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, warned of dire consequences if it is also taken out of the EU, both economically and constitutionally. Only Wales and England voted to leave, which was enough to deliver a Brexit vote.

A large minority

May’s problem is that the Remain vote (although the minority) was very large across the UK, at 48%. It was also sufficiently clustered to embolden Sturgeon and McGuinness to take the UK government to task. Westminster is sovereign, so there is no legal recourse for the devolved institutions to stand up to the UK government in the manner that they are doing but they do equally have a mandate to speak up for Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Remain voters in England and Wales are also sympathetic to Scotland and Northern Ireland’s cause. Although Leave won the referendum with 51.9% of the UK vote, democracy is never a single event. No subject – especially one as significant as this – in a mature liberal democracy is ever answered fully by a referendum. Put simply, the debate continues as Leave voters know all too well.

The debate also continued after 1975 when the UK voted to stay part of the European Economic Area, it continued after the passing of many treaties in bills in the House of Commons, and it would have continued if Remain had won in 2016 (particularly if it was only by 51.9%). It is disingenuous of Leave supporters to now argue the “people have spoken” and expect the debate to end. The majority have spoken but the substantial minority are significant enough to pose a constitutional, political, and economic risk to the UK if Brexiteers continue believing they have an “overwhelming” mandate. Indeed, what is surprising about the mandate is its smallness.

PA/Stefan Rousseau

May, David Davis, Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and the other Brexiteers in the government (and on the opposition) have no option but to listen to Remainers – especially those representing nations that voted to stay, such as Sturgeon and McGuinness. The consequences of not doing so would be dire for relations within the UK during the Brexit talks and possibly afterwards if Scotland is seen to be treated as little more than an afterthought by the Brexit government.

So far, the hubris of the Brexiteers appears to be clouding their judgement. The task ahead is substantial. The stakes are not just the future economic prosperity of the UK but also questions of whether the UK will remain together. At this point there is a real risk that, by the end of this process, Wales and England will stand alone as a UK outside the EU and shunned by the world.

A kingdom at stake

So, how can May demonstrate she is listening? She can first acknowledge that the referendum result was a slim victory for Leave. It is not a huge endorsement for a hard Brexit. Indeed, it is a slim endorsement for something which no one appears to understand. By acknowledging the slimness of the vote it will give her room to manoeuvre which she desperately needs.

May also needs to acknowledge that for Scotland and Northern Ireland “remain means remain”. They want to remain a member of the European Union and the single market. Regardless of it being a United Kingdom vote, it would be constitutionally and politically bold to ignore that. Should May attempt to do so, it is highly probable that a second independence referendum in Scotland could occur. Whatever the result of that, the symbolism would be very negative.

The possible consequences in Northern Ireland could include growing calls to remain in the European Union through reunification with Ireland. If faced with significant economic decline these calls could become very convincing if the UK is seen to be acting in a detrimental manner and failing to take the peace process seriously. These are big issues that May and the Brexiteers simply can’t afford to ignore in favour of pursuing their victory. But they look increasingly like they are running off the edge of a cliff knowing full well what they are about to do."

But what should the rest of us make of it? My gut tells me Scotland is heading for a vote on independence again, but I wouldn’t yet bet my house on it – the decision remains wrapped up in several unresolved issues.

Above all, the SNP don’t want to hold a second referendum until they think they can win. Support for independence is currently not far from 2014 levels, despite Brexit. It sounds simple to hold back a referendum until enough people tell you they’ll vote yes, but who can say if that’s likely? Many Scots don’t know what their choice will be in a referendum until they can make sense of recent events.

So Brexit might be a game changer in a year or two, but it isn’t right now – according to the latest poll, even a so-called hard Brexit in which the UK leaves the European single market would not be enough to give the yes side a decisive lead. Sturgeon may yet have to choose to pursue a referendum in circumstances she would clearly prefer to avoid: before the polls change in her favour.

Unclear Brexit

The lack of clarity in the polls is probably because it is too soon to know what Brexit will look like. The idea of Brexit is still too abstract and not yet related to the arguments that might win the day for a yes vote. If you don’t really know what something is, how it relates to your life, and who you should blame for that outcome, how can you express a view on its effect on your political preferences?

The SNP will likely base their case for a second referendum on a combination of simple statements about Brexit: England is pulling Scotland out of the EU against our will; the Tories caused this problem; we want to clear up the mess they caused; it’s rich for them to warn us about disastrous economic risks around independence; and we want to be a cosmopolitan Scotland, not the rump of little England.

The risk is that Scottish voters might see the Brexit vote as a cautionary tale. It is not easy to argue that the best response to the catastrophic effects of a withdrawal from a major political, economic and social union should be to withdraw from another major political, economic and social union.

This is particularly true now that Brexit has opened up the possibility of more devolution, which had previously been more or less closed off. A feasible alternative to independence is to push for more autonomy in the areas that are devolved and currently “Europeanised” – including agriculture, fishing and environmental policies.

The UK could grant that and perhaps convincingly argue that the Scots were “equals on a range of areas”. When the former Scottish health secretary, Alex Neil, talks about “neo-independence”, this is the sort of thing he has in mind.

Advantage Sturgeon?

So I’d describe Sturgeon’s announcement as a short-term win: why not give your most active audience something to cheer about while you wait for events to unfold? But predicting the timing of a referendum is no easier than before. It will be the point at which (a) we know enough about the meaning of Brexit to judge its likely impact, but (b) there is still time to respond within the timetable of the UK’s exit from the EU.

Some people are worrying that the UK government might scupper the SNP’s chances directly, by withholding consent for a second referendum. Maybe it would be better to be tricksy indirectly, being vague about the impact of Brexit and having people in Scotland worry about making a choice before they know its effect."

Calls for the UK to reclaim its seas and fish were emotive and significant elements of the Brexit campaign. But, as Britain now enters the Brexit era, what actually are the legal implications of withdrawal for UK fisheries?

First things first: change may be afoot, but it will not be quick. Until the UK formally invokes Article 50, fisheries regulation will remain as it was before the referendum.

Economic stability is undoubtedly the short-term priority. Fisheries may be particularly valuable in Aberdeenshire, Shetland or along England’s east coast, but the industry still comprises less than 0.1% of the UK’s GDP. As in the past, continued access for European fleets to British fishing grounds may form part of a final compromise between the UK and the EU.

Too complex to change overnight

Reforming the law will take considerable time and effort. A quick look at the marine management blue book, an online database of fisheries legislation, reveals more than 100 different laws or policy instruments at the EU and domestic level alone. Brexit does not mean fisheries will become simpler. Being in or out of Europe does not change the need for regulation to ensure fishing is conducted safely and sustainably.

Although most fisheries law is derived from the EU, there are important pieces of domestic legislation which may remain in force, regardless of Brexit. The UK’s territorial sea, continental shelf (seabed) and 200 nautical mile “exclusive economic zone” are established under domestic law, for instance. These will not require review, unless Scotland gains independence and so require the redrawing of international boundaries. Scottish waters comprise 62% of the UK total and contain many productive fishing grounds.

Brexit may provide an opportunity to update and consolidate some of the UK’s diffuse and dated fishing laws. Parts of the basic legal framework are nearly 50 years old now, such as the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967. But these domestic laws are still interwoven with their EU equivalents. By itself, UK law does not provide anywhere near a complete regulatory regime for fishing and so, while some domestic laws may continue, there will need to be a wholesale review.

The Common Fisheries Policy

The CFP is the most important part of Britain’s fisheries regulation. And it will continue to apply until the UK formally withdraws from the EU. Even then UK vessels will still have to comply with EU rules on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing if they want to sell their fish to Europe.

It has been a controversial policy. And one rightly criticised. Yet, it is something of an irony that reforms introduced in 2014 have begun to yield positive results. More stocks are being fished at the maximum sustainable yield, and economic efficiency has improved in some sectors. (with the exception of the Mediterranean). The North Sea has been an example of this, and British trawlers in particular have benefited.

While the CFP regulates fishing, the UK has wide discretion over who it allocates its quota too, generally favouring large, factory-scale ships. The Dutch-controlled Cornelis Vrolijk and Interfish ships, and the British firm Andrew Marr hold a 61% share of the UK quota. Legal challenges in favour of smaller, low-impact vessels have failed. This indicates Brexit may not entail a change in domestic allocation practices.

Global oceans, global deals

The UK is a party to both the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS) and the Fish Stocks Agreement 1995. These treaties mean the UK will still have to negotiate and share responsibilities with neighbouring states in the waters around the UK, and on the high seas, regardless of Brexit.

UNCLOS entitles the UK to sovereign rights to explore and exploit natural resources in its exclusive economic zone. The call to “take back our seas” implies ownership or exclusivity – going it alone. This is unlikely. Under international law, coastal states are stewards, not owners, of their exclusive economic zone, and obliged to cooperate in fisheries management.

This may entail allowing foreign fleets access to fish stocks in coastal waters.

The EU currently represents the UK on the organisations that manage regional fisheries, either covering a particular area or a migratory species like tuna. The UK will need to secure membership in order to benefit from quota allocations of valuable fish such as mackerel. Yet it seems unlikely that the UK could simply continue on the same terms as its EU membership, and admitting new states is a headache as existing members want to maintain their own quotas.

Nonetheless, securing fishing agreements with EU neighbours is essential. The UK has too many maritime neighbours to ignore, and fish don’t notice or respect international boundaries.

These are just some of the challenges an already stretched civil service will have to meet if it is to uphold international commitments and ensure UK interests are advanced.

In our view, Brexit is unlikely to produce a radical revolution in fishing regulation and allocation. At least in the short to medium term. There is scope for change, but it must ensure fishing is conducted in a truly sustainable manner, and in a way that ensures the integrity and security of marine ecosystems. Britain can’t do this alone – even after Brexit."

Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, was asked in a BBC interview on Sunday June 26 whether her parliament might withhold the consent required to pass the UK legislation required to leave the EU. Scotland faces losing its EU status despite every local authority voting to Remain in the EU referendum. “That’s got to be on the table,” she replied. “You’re not going to vote for something that is not in Scotland’s interests.”

Is it true? The short answer is no. Alex Salmond was quick to point this out in another BBC interview when he stressed that the “word ‘veto’ never passed her lips”.

The reason for possible confusion is that if Westminster decides to pass legislation that will affect issues under Holyrood jurisdiction, the Scottish parliament needs to be consulted and pass a motion of consent first. The Scotland Act 2016 passed on the back of the Scottish independence referendum put this on a statutory footing, though it was the recognised practice anyway.

According to the Act:

the parliament of the United Kingdom will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish parliament.

The Brexit changes will certainly fall into the category that requires this consent. The laws that tie the UK to the EU require to be repealed – most notably the European Communities Act 1972. These laws are intrinsic to how the Scottish parliament operates, since for example all legislation it passes has to comply with EU law.

Given that every Scottish local authority has voted to remain in the EU and most Holyrood politicians took the same view, Nicola Sturgeon was therefore correct to raise the prospect of the Scottish parliament withholding a “legislative consent” motion for repealing these laws.

Yet like most things in life, context is all. The sovereignty of Westminster on its own decisions is also guaranteed by the legislation around devolution. It says the relevant laws do not “affect the power of the parliament of the United Kingdom to make laws for Scotland”.

This means that power ultimately rests with Westminster. Even if the Scottish parliament registers concern or outright opposition, the laws to exit the EU could still be passed. This may be politically problematic but Westminster’s power has no statutory restriction by the Scotland Acts. So to call it a “veto” is inaccurate.

The issue was even put to the test during the passage of the UK’s Welfare Reform Act of 2012. The Scottish parliament declined to grant legislative consent amid fears that the welfare cuts in the legislation would hurt the poor. It made no difference: the law was passed and fully implemented across the UK.

Consent and indyref2

This phantom “veto” is not the only Scottish constitutional issue to emerge from the earthquake of the EU referendum. The Scottish referendum that was once described as “once in a generation” is now “highly likely” to be repeated before the UK’s Brexit negotiations conclude, according to Sturgeon.

The legal issues around this so-called “indyref2” (second independence referendum) are not straightforward, however. The first referendum of September 2014 only came about following the Edinburgh Agreement between the Scottish and UK government. Westminster had to temporarily transfer powers to the Scottish parliament to run the referendum in a move that expired on December 31 2014.

The devolution legislation is ambiguous at best on Holyrood’s power to run an independence referendum of its own. The constitution is a reserved matter and by signing the Edinburgh Agreement, the Scottish government seemed to concede that Westminster approval is necessary.

If Westminster blocked a future referendum it would therefore have a legal basis to do so. Indeed prior to Brexit, this was the position of David Cameron, the prime minister. He said:

I think it is important that a referendum is legal and properly constituted and that is what we had, and it was decisive, so I do not see the need for another one.

Yet the question is as much political as legal. The idea of Westminster rejecting a referendum in the face of a deepening European constitutional crisis and contrary to the wishes of the Scottish government seems unlikely. The Scottish parliament would probably carry on regardless, even if it creates a legal minefield. The general public’s crash course in constitutional law may run for some time to come."

But a look at the geography of the vote provides another angle on the result and insights into the political geography of the Disunited Kingdom.

The vote laid bare a seldom-acknowledged political and economic imbalance within the country. It has also raised the chances of dissolving a more than three centuries-old union.

Regional inequality

The very first result of the referendum came from Gibraltar, the giant rock in southern Spain at the mouth of the Mediterranean, home to 32,000. It was not a useful predictor of events to unfold as close to 96 percent of the votes cast were to stay with the EU. The reason: the EU assures that Gibraltar remains British and deflects Spanish claims. With the U.K. outside of the EU, Spain can press home their claim. Spain has already asserted the right to some form of joint control over the rock.

A major area of support for remaining in the EU was centered on London. So-called Greater London comprises 7.5 million people and the greater metropolitan region has a population of approximately 21 million. The reach of the city extends into most of the South East part of the country and beyond.

The city and its extended metropolitan dominate the nation. The wealthy, the influential, the movers and shakers live in the city; it is home to royalty, the political elites, those who control much of the making and moving of money. It is by far the most affluent part of Britain. London has emerged a global financial center attracting expertise and investment from across the globe and around Europe. London is hard-wired into the financial circuits of the EU and global economy.

For the past 30 years the principal aim of government economic policy has been, arguably, to protect London’s position, particularly as a financial center, while leaving the rest of the country largely ignored. In the U.K. version of trickle-down economics, London is the golden goose whose droppings fertilize the rest of the country. In reality there was not much trickle and the U.K., like the U.S., is becoming a more unequal society.

There is a spatial dimension to this social inequality. The U.K. has the most marked regional inequality in Europe. The rich and wealthy are concentrated in London and the South East where household incomes are higher than the rest of the country. As the U.K. became a more unequal and divided society, the cleavage between London and the South East compared to the rest of the country is becoming more marked.

Now let’s look the rest of England and Wales, where the majority voted to leave. The people in these regions, especially the lower income groups, were bypassed by the emphasis on the London money machine. Spatially, class conflict was often framed as the South East versus the rest of the country, although in reality the divisions were as much social and spatial.

But even though there existed this discontent with the South East power center in Wales and other parts of England, it was never strong enough to lead to demands for political separation as it could in Scotland. There was no constitutional basis and so the rest of of England and Wales seethed at the rising inequality and neglect.

The exit vote was prompted by many things, especially a disquiet at immigration, but is was also a vote against the dominance of London and the political establishment. The exit vote managed to capture popular resentment against the status quo just as Trump and Sanders did in the U.S.

Divergent interests

All districts in Scotland voted to remain in the EU. This is a complete reversal to the 1975 referendum when Scotland voted against joining the EU when much of the rest of the country embraced the European project.

What happened? The EU provided benefits to Scotland that the London-biased U.K. government did not. Scotland’s political culture, it turns out, is closer to the EU than that of London-based Tories. And years of punishing Thatcher rule in the 1980s soured many in Scotland against a reliance on the U.K. political system. The EU softened the neoliberalism of English Tory rule.

The Brexit vote highlights the problem of sharing a political space with divergent interests. The Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh will now move to draft legislation for another referendum on Scottish independence. The result could be different from the one in 2014 when 55 percent voted to stay in. The Brexit vote may herald the break up a Union first crafted in 1707.

Northern Ireland, as a whole, also voted to remain in the EU. But the Anglo Welsh vote across the water that tipped the balance in the opposite direction raises new issues for the province. Northern Ireland, the only part of the U.K. that has a land border with an EU country, is in a similar economic position to Scotland but in a very different political context. The province is split between those who want to join up with Eire and those who want to stay in the U.K. Sinn Féin, the party that seeks union with Ireland, has already proposed a vote on all Ireland unification.

The future

The geography of the Brexit vote tells us much about the political geography of the U.K. Buy what about the political future of the U.K.?

The Brexit vote reveals and embodies the deep divide in the U.K. between the different regions of England and Wales and especially between the affluent London and the South East. This division is unlikely to heal soon.

The different voting patterns between Scotland, Wales and England outside of the South East may herald the break up of the U.K. The United Kingdom was always something of a misnomer. It is not a kingdom – the head of state currently is a queen – and it is not all that united. The Brexit vote is likely to exacerbate the breakup of Britain."

The economics of Brexit was heatedly and endlessly debated in the UK’s referendum campaign on EU membership, but ultimately it was trumped by voters’ considerations about national integrity and identity. A majority of 17.4m people voted to leave, against 16.1m for remain.

How the drama unfolded

Assiduous watchers of the early referendum results had been advised that if the outcome in Sunderland (perenially among the first to declare election results) showed anything more than a six-point winning margin for Leave, then Brexit would be the likely outcome nationally. Anything less, however, and Remain could expect overall victory.

In the event, Sunderland produced a remarkable 22-point margin in favour of Leave (61-39), while nearby Newcastle, which had been expected to produce a comfortable margin for Remain, only narrowly favoured the pro-EU choice (51% to 49%). The value of sterling fell off a cliff as the currency markets reacted to these early shocks, but the Remain side’s nerves were briefly steadied a little by better than predicted results in Swindon and Lewisham.

But the bad news for Remain continued to pile up, as a pattern of polarisation emerged, with Leave areas proving even more hostile to the EU than had been expected, especially in the north, eastern England and Wales, and Remain areas being more supportive, at least in parts of London.

At 72%, turnout was extraordinarily high by the standards of recent general elections, but especially in the pro-Leave areas. Appalling weather on the day may have depressed turnout in London, while the other major pro-Leave zone, Scotland, saw a lower than average turnout as well – 67%. By 2am, quantitative forecasters were giving Remain a negligible chance of winning, and predicting 56% for Leave, while the bookies now made the Brexit side favourites to win.

By 2.30am there were glimmers of renewed hope for the increasingly despondent Remain campaign with the first results coming in from London – a massive 79% pro-Remain vote from Lambeth, followed shortly after by a 75% pro-Remain vote in Wandsworth, and 70% in Hammersmith and Fulham. This was enough to put Remain in the lead once again, yet only fleetingly.

Ultimately these pockets of pro-European sentiment were not enough and by 5.30am the outcome was confirmed: the UK had voted to leave the EU.

The final figures showed a 52%-48% winning majority on a 72% turnout. Voters had understood that this was a more existential question than a mere general election and mobilised in greater numbers than had been their wont for nearly two decades.

In demographic terms, the Remain and Brexit camps have been well defined for some time. Support for Brexit resembles that for UKIP in various ways, with particular strengths among older people, lower social class and less well educated voters. In YouGov’s last referendum poll conducted on the day of the vote itself, Leave seemed to enjoy commanding leads among voters aged over 50, and those whose highest educational qualification was GCSE or lower. Remain was the clear preference of those aged 18-49 and those educated to A-Level or degree standard.

While Remain voters were primarily motivated by concerns about the economy and what was in the best interests of their families, Leave supporters were chiefly driven by the desire to enhance the UK’s ability to act independently of other countries and to deal with the issue of immigration. The country split quite neatly into those for whom pocketbook considerations were paramount (and who opted for Remain) and those who sought to protect national integrity and identity (and who chose to Leave).

Referendum geography

The polarisation of the UK is now sharply apparent in geographical terms. The vote for Brexit was strongest in a swathe of areas running down the east of England, especially in parts of Lincolnshire, Essex and the East Midlands, while London, Scotland and Northern Ireland remain the outposts of pro-EU sentiment. With Wales also voting for Leave, the electoral picture shows a nation divided.

Beyond the UK (or what will eventually be left of it) the ramifications will be felt with great resonance: populists in France, Italy and the Netherlands have demanded their own national referenda on EU membership. Closer to home, relations between two Irelands, one in the EU and one outside it, will bring further complexity to that island’s convoluted and troubled politics. This one will run and run."

Would it lead to a second independence referendum and then a vote for independence?

In the aftermath of the result, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has given the clearest indication of what the answer will be. She told a press conference it is now “highly likely” a second independence referendum will be held.

It comes after a clean sweep of Scottish local authorities voted to remain in the EU but faces being forced out by the Anglo-Welsh Brexit vote. She said the Scottish government would begin drafting legislation to make such a referendum possible.

It was a bold move by the SNP leader, implicitly daring Westminster to suggest such a vote will have no legal basis. Yet she was cautious, too. She cleverly hasn’t committed to a timescale and said the Scottish government will look to open channels of communication with the EU and other member states. This will buy her time while the UK gets its Brexit negotiations underway, allowing her to showcase to Scottish unionists her competency in standing up for the nation’s interests in this fraught period.

The debate about Scottish self-government intensified from Margaret Thatcher’s time in office in the 1980s, when Scottish support for the ruling Conservatives fell away sharply. Much was made of the complaint that what the electorate in the south of England voted for was imposed in Scotland against the people’s democratic will. It was one of the driving forces in the creation of the Scottish parliament in 1999 and a key argument for Scottish independence in the 2014 referendum.

The EU referendum result has brought this issue to the fore in perhaps the most acute manner yet. This result represents what was described in the SNP’s manifesto for the Scottish election in May as the kind of “material change in circumstances” in Scotland’s status as a constituent part of the UK that would justify a second referendum. As such, Sturgeon referred to it in her press conference.

One reason why EU membership has long been given this status by Sturgeon and her senior colleagues is that during the 2014 referendum campaign, the pro-UK Better Together campaign argued Scotland was more likely to stay a member of the EU as part of the UK. Far from being allowed to continue, Better Together claimed the EU would make Scotland apply for membership from scratch and be denied some of the UK’s favourable conditions – how ironic this looks now.

Treading lightly

So now that the unionists have played right into the SNP’s hand, why the need for caution? First, the party will want to wait and see how the post-Brexit negotiations play out. The deal that the UK is able to secure with the EU, whether it is some sort of continued membership of the single market or something much looser, will be crucial for the Scottish electorate when it comes to making a cost-benefit analysis of what Brexit actually means.

A number of devolved policy areas such as fisheries and farming are in actual fact Europeanised in the sense that the major decisions are taken at an EU level. Taking the Common Fisheries Policy as an example, Marine Scotland would take sole responsibility for the management of fish stocks in Scottish territorial waters, with its operations under more direct scrutiny from the Scottish parliament as a result.

Brexit therefore actually enhances some of the powers and competencies of the Scottish parliament, something that those who back devolution over independence may well take into consideration. Having said that, there are questions for the Scottish government and Scottish parliament regarding the oversight and scrutiny of these policy areas in future.

Secondly, if Scotland was to vote for independence and was able to remain a member state of the EU, it would share its land border with a non-member. The last independence referendum campaign threw up a number of difficult questions about a shared currency and cross-border trade that will be even more tricky to answer in a post-Brexit contest.

The mechanics of the possible relationship between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK are therefore significantly altered to what they were in 2014. This requires a rethink from the Scottish government and the wider pro-independence movement on what shape and form Scottish independence ought to take.

The Quebec precedent

The third and probably most crucial reason for holding off from the point of view of the SNP is that there is little evidence to suggest that support for independence would receive a significant boost as a result of Brexit. The SNP’s leadership is keen to avoid Scotland “doing a Quebec” where a second referendum on independence took place and was defeated, and over 20 years later the prospects of it holding another are all but dead.

The fiscal and economic conditions that an independent Scotland would be subjected to are significantly worse than they were in 2014, with the North Sea struggling due to the low price of oil. This would leave Scotland with an estimated fiscal deficit of £11.9bn (7.8% of GDP) compared to the UK’s fiscal deficit of £59.8bn (3.3% of GDP). It is also unclear how important Scottish voters feel membership of the EU is and whether or not it is more important than economic risk – one of the most important factors that led to a No vote.

That the SNP had not yet persuaded the Scottish electorate to choose independence in spite of these problems is highlighted by a paradox in the party’s 2016 election manifesto: while the “material change of circumstances” clause has clearly been triggered, another SNP referendum test has not. The manifesto talks about requiring clear and sustained support amongst the Scottish electorate for independence before a second referendum would go on the table. A source within the SNP has previously stated that support for independence would have to consistently remain at about 60% for this to be satisfied.

Clearly the SNP felt such a clear Scottish mandate to stay in the EU could only be met with a strong signal that the second referendum is now all but irresistible. Yet Nicola Sturgeon’s caution, preceded by a round of interviews by former leader Alex Salmond, shows that victory is far from in the bag – even in the face of such a difference of opinion with the English and Welsh.

In the timeframe available, she will hope that the pro-independence movement can awaken again and mobilise with the same vigour as last time – and that Brexit really does tip enough Scottish unionists towards supporting independence. The SNP will then have to win the argument or potentially face the same fate as their counterparts in Quebec.

No one is suggesting Scottish turnout will be anywhere near the 85% of that poll – more likely 20 points below. Yet the EU referendum could have fascinating implications for Scotland.

All polls indicate a close result across the UK, but a very clear Remain vote in Scotland (and Northern Ireland). This leaves three realistic scenarios. Scotland could vote to stay in while the UK votes to leave – thanks to England. The UK could vote to stay in by a very narrow margin, with a Scottish Remain majority effectively blocking a narrow English vote to leave. Or the UK could vote Remain, with both England and Scotland in favour.

Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, and her senior SNP colleagues have long said Scotland being forced from the EU against its will would be the kind of “material change” that would justify a second independence referendum. But would they want to? The first minister has also openly stated the Scottish government would only call for a referendum if public opinion indicates a significant uplift from the 45% Yes vote of 2014 – probably towards about 60%.

A large number of middle-class Scots voted No because of the economic uncertainty of independence. In the event of a Brexit vote, the same rationale may make them lean the other way if they thought an independent Scotland could remain in the EU. Current EU referendum polling certainly indicates the better off in Scotland are more likely to vote Remain. On the other hand, the fact that Scottish voters see the EU referendum as less important than the independence referendum suggests the EU result may not alter their opinion about Scottish independence.

Either way, the Scottish government is likely to be cautious. Since economic certainty is important for these swing voters, it may be a case of seeing what happens. The UK’s exit negotiations with the EU may not run smoothly – the EU may wish to signal to the likes of the eurosceptic French that the exit path carries costs. That could boost support for independence among these middle class Scots, though how voters react to uncertainty is itself uncertain.

If so, we would then probably see debates about an independent Scotland’s relationship to the remainder of the UK’s “single market” and its currency – indeed, Sturgeon has already indicated there would be discussions about Scotland joining the eurozone in the event of a Brexit. Many would want to know how welcoming the EU would be to an independent Scotland and whether fast-track entry would be possible.

Even if the SNP did feel there was the momentum for another “indyref”, bear in mind the power to hold a legally secure referendum is reserved to Westminster. In this UK Leave/Scotland Remain scenario, would it authorise another vote? My guess is it would depend on the strength of feeling. David Cameron may well resist one, but a post-Brexit leader might take a different view, perhaps in a bid to shelve independence for a generation. But they might play hardball with timing, the nature of the question and so forth.

The ‘Scotland blocks Brexit’ scenario

On one level there ought to be no problem with our second scenario. Leading Brexiters presented themselves as strongly British unionists during both referendum campaigns, so they shouldn’t complain if the UK has voted as the UK. Yet it is still easy to imagine the idea of Scotland obstructing the will of England becoming a major political flashpoint.

How it played out would depend on whether David Cameron was prime minister. If he remained there would be little immediate change, yet it would be an era of even more political positioning and posturing than now. Cameron would probably face rebellions on European issues from pro-Brexit Tories similar to John Major’s premiership post-Maastricht. He would be relying on opposition support for such votes, not least perhaps from the SNP voting bloc.

This could exacerbate the sense of injustice among English nationalists already decrying the EU referendum as a European version of the West Lothian question (the problem of Scottish MPs potentially holding the casting vote at Westminster on purely English issues).

The situation could become more dangerous when the prime minister steps down. The new leader in a party whose root and branch is predominantly pro-Brexit would likely tack towards English nationalism – as Cameron himself attempted immediately after the Scottish independence referendum (his plan for English votes for English laws has led to some procedural changes in the Commons).

The substance of this nationalism would matter. Would it broadly focus on tolerance, democracy and respect for diversity? Or would it be more exclusionary and self-assertive, responding to what it saw as the threats to English society? If it were more the latter that might be distinctly unwelcome in Scotland, and might have implications for independence support.

On the other hand, it is not impossible to imagine an English nationalist UK government paying less attention to the devolved nations – particularly Scotland, where there are so few Tory MPs and the financial settlement with Westminster has already been agreed until 2020. The Brexiters have barely addressed the Scottish question during the referendum, so we’re really in unknown territory.

Whatever the case, it would be unwise to assume that two referendum victories for Cameron would mean politics would return to the pre-2014 days. You only need look at the Scottish referendum to see that politics rarely plays out this way. Even if the vote is Remain both north and south of the Scotland-England border, there will be a Tory leadership election relatively soon and the party will have substantial divisions to heal following all the “blue on blue” hostility of the EU referendum.

A Brexit leader such as Boris Johnson as prime minister while the Scottish nationalists continue to look for another independence opportunity, would certainly mean interesting times. The outcome of the vote on June 23 could well be an important staging post to whatever happens between England and Scotland next."

Representing Remain were two leading British politicians who scored electoral successes recently – Ruth Davidson, leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, and Sadiq Khan, Labour’s new London mayor. The third figure was Frances O'Grady, leader of the TUC, speaking, as she said, for the workers of Britain.

Leadsom and Stuart repeatedly described themselves as “mothers and grandmothers”, enabling Ruth Davidson to score one of the few laughs of the evening by pointing out that the Remain camp has just as many mothers and grandmothers which they could call upon – perhaps implying that they just don’t go on about it quite as much as Stuart.

The Remainers were the surprise package of the night. The campaign for staying in the EU has allowed itself to look lacklustre during this campaign and has struggled to sell its more complex economic and immigration arguments. This was not a problem during this debate. The Remain camp has clearly had a shot in the arm, typified particularly by the performances of Davidson and Khan.

While O'Grady was able to speak with authority about workers and their rights, Davidson and Khan repeatedly hammered the Leave campaign, accusing them of lying and misleading voters. They demanded detailed plans on the future, with Khan reminding Johnson that “slogans aren’t policies”. Khan even hit back at accusations that he represented “project fear” by calling the Leave campaign “project hate”, referring to its immigration rhetoric and focusing on what he believed were inaccuracies in the material produced by the Leave campaign.

The Leave team was also blindsided by a question about a £600,000 donation from a former BNP supporter.

By the time the concluding statements were made, Johnson had drawn a standing ovation from some quarters of the hall for his attempt at rousing conclusion suggesting that Thursday would be Britain’s Independence Day.

However, there is no doubt that the real star was Davidson. She highlighted issues she believed were not being presented accurately and demanded justification of key claims from the Leave campaign. Fresh from the Scottish parliamentary election campaign, she demonstrated her ability to fight for what she believes and to communicate in a way that is both engaging and straightforward."

The most recent surveys suggest the outcome is too close to call, with those favoring an exit holding a slight lead and many undecided.

The campaign has been bitter, although the murder of pro-EU Labour Member of Parliament Jo Cox by an alleged “Britain First” supporter led to some soul-searching by all sides. As British actor Hugh Laurie tweeted:

I hate this referendum, for turning a question of unfathomable complexity into Lord of the Flies. — Hugh Laurie (@hughlaurie) June 17, 2016

While the referendum is over the U.K.’s place in the EU, a vote to leave could have far-reaching consequences for the kingdom itself because its constituent parts – England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – hold differing views on Europe.

So the question is, if there’s a Brexit – a British exit from the EU – what happens to the regions of the U.K.? Does it mean a breakup might soon follow?

Trouble looming

If you need a primer on the situation, John Oliver has you covered. The short version is that voters in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland will vote on June 23 on whether to remain in the EU a little more than three decades after joining it.

One fascinating angle to this referendum for me, as someone who has long studied Scottish and Welsh nationalism and its connection to the EU, is what effect a Brexit vote would have on the United Kingdom’s own unity.

Recent polls have shown hints of trouble looming for the United Kingdom if Brexit happens, with its regions expressing disparate views on the referendum. In Scotland, which rejected independence from the U.K. in its own referendum less than two years ago, a majority of voters say they want to stay in the EU. These results suggest that a Brexit could be quickly followed by another Scottish referendum, this one on whether to leave the U.K. and perhaps join the EU.

A Belfast telegraph poll showed that Northern Irish voters also prefer to remain in the EU by a wide margin (54 percent to 35 percent). Except for Wales, the periphery of the United Kingdom opposes Brexit far more than their English counterparts.

And while London may be unlikely to secede from the U.K., its voters also favor staying in the EU (45 percent to 40 percent).

Scotland and the EU

In a recent interview, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon argued that given the strength of the remain vote in her region, it would be “democratically indefensible, if we had voted to stay in, to face the prospect of being taken out.”

As such, both former British Prime Minister John Major and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne have warned of a second Scottish independence referendum in the case of Brexit.

Sturgeon has not yet officially advocated for another referendum in such an event, but she is campaigning strongly for the U.K. to remain in the EU. And in part, she is using Scottish political history over the last 40 years to bolster the case.

One of the chief complaints of Scottish nationalists from 1979 onwards was that the Tories, then led by Margaret Thatcher, ruled the UK from Westminster despite never winning in Scotland. This democratic deficit continued until former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s victory in 1997 and subsequent devolution referendum later that year. If Scotland is pulled out of the EU against its democratic wishes, it may fuel another round of Scottish nationalism.

Looking back, one of the keys to the defeat of its 2014 independence referendum was the uncertainty of an independent Scotland’s role in the EU. As I argued in my 2015 book “The European Union and the Rise of Regionalist Parties,” this uncertainty over whether Scotland would be able to immediately join the EU contributed to concerns over the viability of an independent Scotland, which hurt the “yes” campaign in the referendum.

While I believe that similar uncertainty over Brexit and a U.K. breakup will likely favor the status quo in this week’s vote, if things go the other way, a new Scottish independence referendum in the near future seems likely, as Sturgeon and former SNP leader Alex Salmond have made clear.

Northern Ireland’s new border

Elsewhere in the periphery, the questions are just as sharp.

For Northern Ireland, not only has the EU played a significant role in the peace process, but the border and trade agreements between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom would be fundamentally challenged after Brexit. As the Telegraph reports, if Brexit occurred, the boundary between Ireland and Northern Ireland – which currently allows free flow of trade and travel – would have to be strengthened.

The border would then be an external EU border, requiring more controls on either side to prevent unwanted migration and monitor customs flow. Any additional restrictions on immigration increase transactions costs and hinder trade and travel, as residents along the American-Canadian border experienced after 9/11.

Though the threat of an independence referendum in Northern Ireland does not seem to be in the cards (despite the wishes of Sinn Fein), the risks and uncertainty associated with Brexit will undoubtedly affect relations in the region. A return to violence is not out of the question.

Weighing the odds of a Brexit

Despite my own views on the likely outcome of the June 23 vote, as noted above, polls suggest Brexit might win.

Similar to what research showed in earlier EU referendums in Netherlands and Denmark, anti-immigration attitudes are a key driver of Brexit votes. But a major uncertainty about the referendum vote is turnout.

According to the polling firm YouGov, the youngest voters (18-24) are the most supportive of remaining in the EU (60 percent for “remain”), while older ones (65+) are far more euroskeptical (59 percent for “leave”).

At the same time, young people are less likely to actually vote. Just 56 percent of 18-24-year-olds say they would be absolutely certain to vote, compared with 86 percent of 65+ voters. Thus, getting out the youth vote is crucial to the remain campaign’s success.

That being said, the betting markets suggest that a vote to remain is much more likely than a vote for Brexit. What makes them so sure despite the results of recent polling? Most significantly, risk aversion in British referendums tends to favor the status quo. Basically, voters fear the risks associated with change more when they are in the voting booth than when they are responding to polls.

And, as historian Timothy Garton Ash argues in a Guardian op-ed, the uncertainty and risks associated with Brexit are tremendous, with most economists agreeing that there would be serious short- and medium-term adverse consequences for the British economy.

In my own work on the topic, I’ve shown how actual voting in referendums can differ substantially from what the survey polls suggest, such as in the 1979 campaign to devolve powers to Scotland and more recently in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Thus, history suggests that the vote to remain will make up some ground on referendum day.

But if voters thumb their nose at history…

Hypothetically, though, if the leave campaign wins, what would that mean for the U.K.?

In the short run, the border issues between Northern Ireland and Ireland would be part of the messy and complicated divorce proceedings and involve the EU, U.K. and Ireland. In the longer term, if the EU/U.K. breakup weakens Irish dependence on the U.K. and leads to a greater continental focus for Ireland, then Northern Irish voters may reconsider whether Ireland or the U.K. is a better fit.

In Scotland, the short-run story seems similar. The latest polling suggests that Scottish voters would be more likely to take a wait-and-see approach rather than immediately opt for a new independence referendum. At whatscotlandthinks.org, political scientist John Curtice has compiled eight recent polls that show a slight point swing in favor of independence in the case of Brexit. However, the swing is not quite enough to hit the 60 percent threshold that the Scottish National Party has said it would need to trigger a new independence referendum.

However, these hypothetical polls in Scotland are just that, hypotheticals. If the remain camp is right and Brexit leads to a dramatic recession and decreased economic growth, then a downturn that can be directly linked to membership in the United Kingdom will increase support for a second referendum.

In short, the costs of Brexit for the United Kingdom will reverberate for years to come."

Both teams are jostling for position and the race is becoming increasingly acrimonious. The Leave campaign has abandoned the economic arguments and instead is focusing almost exclusively on migration.

The Remain campaign continues to release dire warnings of a post-Brexit world that seems to include all ten plagues of Egypt except slaughter of the firstborn. Following some good polls for Leave in the past couple of days, the poll of polls currently points to a 50-50 dead heat.

Bookies too have been adjusting the odds offered as they seek to maximise their expected gain from the outcome. Over the last few weeks, this resulted in a substantial fall in the implied probability of a Leave outcome – and as I wrote in my previous piece about Brexit odds, the weight of betting was far less promising for Leave than the opinion polls before that anyway.

On April 26, the probability of a vote to leave from the oddschecker.com average of some 20 bookmakers’ odds stood at 0.35, meaning slightly better than a one in three chance. By May 22 it had fallen to 0.22 or almost one in five. Perhaps the tsunami of warnings from national and international organisations of the economic consequences of Brexit was being factored into punters’ assessments of how the vote will go.

Since then, the news for the Brexit camp has got slightly better. The slide was arrested on May 27 and there has been a modest recovery which took the probability of Brexit up to 0.30 by June 6. Perhaps punters were thinking the switch of emphasis to migration will carry more voter appeal: or that they are more confident of a high turnout among Leave supporters.

Of course, these predicted probabilities do not mean that a Leave outcome will not occur – just that it is seen as rather unlikely. They reflect all of the information available to punters. This may be drawn from a wide variety of sources – opinion polls, press coverage, personal contacts and so on. The point has been made elsewhere that punters are not representative of the population as a whole. But they don’t need to be to use this information intelligently.

Indeed, not all those betting need to act in an informed way. So long as there are sufficient well informed punters willing to place their bets where they see an opportunity for gain based on the current odds, the odds will come to reflect the underlying chance that the event occurs (with the small complication that bookies always build in a profit margin).

Will the odds change substantially over the remainder of the campaign? It seems unlikely that they can change sufficiently to suggest that a Leave outcome is more likely than a Remain outcome. Nothing in the history of betting odds suggests that a swing of 24 percentage points is possible over a three-week period.

Ecosse and effect

The Scottish referendum is a useful precedent. Events during the last few weeks included some surprises which perhaps punters had not anticipated. Most important was the closing of the gap between the Yes and No polling.

This had a dramatic effect on media coverage and on the politics during the run-up to the vote. It also influenced the bookies’ odds (see graphic below), increasing the probability of a Yes outcome by 16 percentage points between the 23rd day and the ninth day before the polls. But then the upward momentum petered out and by the time of the vote the odds had fallen back to more or less where they had started.

Betting probability of a Yes vote in Scottish referendum

On June 5, 18 days before the Brexit vote, the probability of a Leave vote stood at 0.30 or 30%. In Scotland, the probability of a Yes vote at the same point before the independence referendum was slightly lower at 0.20.

While the implied probability of the UK leaving the EU is currently higher than the implied probability of Scotland leaving the UK was at that stage, it will take a bigger and more sustained change of events in the last few days of the campaign than that which happened in Scotland to persuade bookies to offer anything like evens on a vote for Brexit.

Update, June 23

It looks to me that the betting markets have made up their mind that the status quo is the likely outcome. Like in the Scottish referendum, a late surge towards the more radical alternative petered out in the last week of the campaign, perhaps because of the incessant warnings about the potential risks of change.

Based on the odds being offered on different outcomes for the size of the Remain vote, the most likely outcome is Remain 53.5% – Leave 46.5%. Of course there is a margin of error associated with this estimate. Gamblers have a financial incentive in making the correct prediction, but they could be wrong. We will soon know one way or the other."

In Scotland, however, the Remain option is clearly in the lead at this stage. This asks some intriguing questions about what will happen after June 23 as the Scottish and European issues have become so deeply entwined. Almost all the possible scenarios seem set to increase constitutional tensions.

The first scenario is that all four nations of the UK vote to withdraw; this seems unlikely. The second scenario is that England votes to come out and Scotland to stay in. English votes mean that Scotland has to leave the EU against its will. This represents the “material change of circumstances” that Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said could justify a new independence referendum.

Tempting though it would be for the nationalists, such a referendum would be a hard sell. The issues of public finance, dependency on oil and the currency are even more acute now. Sharing the pound would be even more difficult if Scotland were within the EU and the UK outside. The whole point of the independence-in-Europe strategy is that it lowers the cost of independence by guaranteeing open borders, access to markets and free movement of labour with both the UK and Europe. With Scotland in the EU and the UK out, there would be a hard border between Scotland and England.

If Scotland were obliged to leave the EU along with England, however, matters would still change. Powers would revert to the UK as a consequence of EU withdrawal, but many of these to Scotland rather than Westminster as they are not reserved. This includes large swathes of powers in relation to agriculture, fisheries, environment, justice and home affairs, higher education and social policy. Scotland could then choose whether to align its policies in these fields more with London or with Brussels, so retaining a stronger connection with Europe if not a role in European policymaking.

Beware the English nationalists

The third scenario from the referendum is that there is an overall majority to stay, caused by Scotland voting decisively in favour and England only voting by a small majority to leave. England is then held in the EU against its own wishes. Brexiters tend to be English nationalists and this will enrage an English opinion already exercised about English Votes for English laws and what they see as Scotland’s favourable financial position. England does not have the option of withdrawing from the UK but some might be tempted to achieve the same result by encouraging Scotland to leave.

The fourth scenario is that all four nations of the UK vote to remain within the EU, avoiding a constitutional crisis in the short term. In the longer term, however, the issue would continue to rankle. David Cameron’s new deal for the UK in Europe has been derided as not living up to the early promise of a radical change in the relationship with the EU.

On the other hand, the whole episode has made it clear that the UK’s wholehearted engagement with the European project is at an end. At UK level, few of those supporting Remain have questioned the drift towards a looser union. Few have supported freedom of movement as a matter of principle rather than a burdensome obligation. The UK’s exemption from the principle of “ever closer union of the peoples of Europe” may look symbolic but it does mean that UK governments will henceforth pick and choose which bits of future agreements they will accept. The opt-out will be the norm rather than the exception. The requirement put in place by the coalition government of 2010-15 that any new transfer of powers to the EU be subject to a referendum will make governments even more cautious.

The question then arises as to whether Scotland would wish to travel in the same direction. There are distinct views in Scotland about the social dimension of Europe, freedom of movement, climate change and renewable and non-renewable energy. There are distinct interests in agriculture and fisheries. Some of these concern devolved matters, where Scotland would want its voice to be heard in the councils of the EU. Others are reserved.

At present, Scotland has a say in EU policymaking through the Joint Ministerial Committee on Europe and Scottish ministers participate in the UK delegation to the Council of the European Union. It does not participate in the European Council (of heads of state and government). These arrangements give Scotland a voice but not a vote, as the final word on the UK negotiating position rests with the Her Majesty’s Government. If differences between the two governments increase, the mechanisms could come under increasing strain."

What would such a decision mean for support for independence in Scotland and Wales? Could there even be implications for the peace deal in Northern Ireland, as the Irish prime minister recently suggested?

At the same time, rather less attention has been paid to the potential for another, equally plausible, outcome. What if England votes narrowly in favour of leaving the EU, but is kept in Europe by its more Europhile UK neighbours? Could such an outcome trigger calls from England for further loosening of ties within the UK?

A nation divisible

All recent survey and polling data confirm that such a gap does indeed exist. Recent polls suggest support for leaving the EU could be as low as 25% in Northern Ireland and 36% in Scotland. In Wales it sits at 45%. Meanwhile, in England, 48% say they would leave (based on averaging recent opinion polls in each country, excluding those who do not know how they will vote).

At the moment then, the polls point to all four countries voting to remain in the EU. But the margin of support for remaining is clearly narrower in England than elsewhere.

Some relatively simple modelling (multiplying the estimated leave vote in each country by that country’s percentage share of the UK population and then summing the totals) enables us to estimate a “tipping point” for votes in England. Above that point, England could take the rest of the UK out of the EU against its will. Below it, and England might be kept in the EU against its will by its neighbours.

NatCen , Author provided

The first thing to note here is that the size of England relative to its neighbours means that a relatively modest majority in favour of leaving there would be enough to outweigh any level of support for remaining in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. If 59.6% of people in England voted to leave the EU, it would be enough to take Britain out of Europe – even if no one in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales voted to leave.

However, if we assume that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in fact vote as indicated above (based on the averages of recent polls in each country), then a narrow vote in England in favour of leaving (between 50 and 52.5%) could be overturned by the popularity of staying in the EU elsewhere in the UK. But if more than 52.5% in England voted to leave, the views of those elsewhere in the UK would be outweighed and the UK as a whole would have a majority (just – 50.1%) in favour of leaving.

Turmoil ahead?

Of course, calculating such a tipping point involves a lot of assumptions. The polls in each country would have to be largely correct, for a start, and opinion would have to remain the same up to the vote.

Given the apparent narrowing of the overall lead for the remain campaign in recent polls (our most recent poll of polls puts support across the UK for remaining at just 51%, compared with 49% for leaving), it is feasible that support for leaving could increase across all four nations, and not just in England.

Tweaking the figures to assume a 4 percentage point increase in support for leaving the EU in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland reduces the tipping point to 51.7% – if the leave vote in England were above this, then the UK as whole would be tipped in favour of leaving even while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland still remained on balance in favour of remaining (albeit only just in Wales in this scenario).

Conversely, if support for leaving the EU fell by 4 percentage points from the figures indicated above in each of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, then at least 53.3% of people in England would need to vote to leave before the UK as a whole would be tipped in favour of leaving.

If the race in England is indeed as tight as current polls suggest, these figures suggest there is considerable potential for the referendum to produce constitutional headaches beyond the specific issue of whether we remain in or leave the EU."
87669,Why claims that Scotland would save £1.5bn out of EU are disingenuous,https://theconversation.com/why-claims-that-scotland-would-save-1-5bn-out-of-eu-are-disingenuous-57374/,11/03/2019,Academic,BREXIT,True,"This is largely because the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) consumes such a large proportion of the EU Budget.
It is also worth noting that Norway and Switzerland, which are both nominally outside the EU, make a net contribution to the EU budget as part of their deals to be part of a free trade area with the EU.
So following Brexit, some proportion of the UK’s net contribution might be redirected to Scotland, in the form of a better designed agricultural policy for example.
Beyond this very simple accounting of Scotland’s net fiscal contribution, membership of the EU brings wider economic benefits and costs.
And importantly, this net fiscal contribution is likely to be outweighed by the wider economic benefits that EU membership brings to Scotland.","claims, scotland, contribution, uk, eu, save, net, uks, 15bn, disingenuous, scottish, scotlands, billion, budget","When Scottish Vote Leave launched on April 5, it had an eye-catching claim. The Scottish government’s annual budget would rise by £1.5 billion in the event of Brexit, we were told. It arrived at this figure by calculating Scotland’s population share of the UK’s gross annual contribution to the EU budget, which was about £18 billion last year.

But the claim is disingenuous for two reasons. First, it ignores the UK’s rebate. The UK’s rebate last year was £4.8 billion. Scotland’s population share of this is £0.4 billion, so that needs to be deducted.

It also ignores the fact that the EU spends a proportion of its budget in the UK. In fact, Scotland does relatively well on EU expenditures. This is largely because the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) consumes such a large proportion of the EU Budget. Scotland will receive around £0.6 billion a year in CAP payments over the 2014-2020 budgeting period, up from £0.5 billion in the late 2000s.

Scotland has also secured from the EU’s Structural Funds programme 2014-20 as much as €941 million (over £100 million per year), which the government will administer to promote economic activity.

Then there are other EU funding streams – for example Horizon 2020, the EU’s programme for promoting research and development, which has a budget of €76 billion for the period 2014-2020. Scotland and the UK have traditionally been very successful at securing this kind of EU funding, but even if Scotland only secured its EU population share this time around, it would equate to just under £100m a year.

From here you can do the maths. Scottish Vote Leave’s £1.5 billion gross contribution falls to £1.1 billion after the rebate and to £0.3 billion after we account for the EU spending that flows back to Scotland (£0.6 billion CAP, at least £0.1 billion in structural funds, and £0.1bn in funding to support research and development). Purely on an accounting basis, membership of the EU costs Scots taxpayers no more than £300 million (and some say less – the Centre on European Reform has estimated Scotland’s net contribution to be less than £100 million).

It is also worth noting that Norway and Switzerland, which are both nominally outside the EU, make a net contribution to the EU budget as part of their deals to be part of a free trade area with the EU. According to the House of Commons Library, Norway contributed around £106 per capita in 2011, while Switzerland contributes around £53 per capita. Scotland’s £300 million contribution equates to around £57 per person.

Brexit bounty?

Brexit campaigners might point out with some justification that the EU’s CAP is not a particularly well designed scheme. It provides support to some very profitable farms; there’s evidence that it raises food prices; and its environmental impact has been questioned.

It is also true that the UK as a whole makes a net contribution to the EU of around £8 billion, according to the Treasury (this is after you deduct the rebate and the EU funding that flows back here). So following Brexit, some proportion of the UK’s net contribution might be redirected to Scotland, in the form of a better designed agricultural policy for example. But there is no guarantee that whatever scheme a UK outside the EU put in place to support the agricultural sector, rural development and the environment would necessarily be better – or more generous – to Scotland.

Beyond this very simple accounting of Scotland’s net fiscal contribution, membership of the EU brings wider economic benefits and costs. There are likely to be benefits from free trade with the EU – not only for Scottish exporters, but more generally from greater choice and enhanced competition and productivity. Membership of the EU may enhance Scotland’s attractiveness as a location for inward investment. And free movement of people provides benefits to firms and local economies. There are over 100,000 EU nationals employed in Scotland, according to my own estimates based on data from the Labour Force Survey.

Estimating the wider economic costs of Brexit on the UK and Scotland is subject to significant uncertainty, of course. It requires assumptions about how the UK’s relationship with the EU would evolve -– what sort of tariff or non-tariff barriers to trade might exist, for example – as well as how Britain’s trading relationship with non-EU countries might change.

Three reports have recently tried to do this, produced by the London School of Economics, Oxford Economics and the CBI. They use different methodologies and each run a number of scenarios using different assumptions. Although there is a lot of uncertainty around the results, all three estimate that Brexit would impose economic costs on the UK. Even under the more optimistic scenarios, Brexit could result in GDP losses of 1%-2% per year. In Scottish terms, this is equivalent to between £1.5 billion and £3 billion.

So in summary, Scottish taxpayers do make a net fiscal contribution to the EU, but this is substantially less than the £1.5 billion quoted by Scottish Vote Leave. And importantly, this net fiscal contribution is likely to be outweighed by the wider economic benefits that EU membership brings to Scotland."

“We are writing to reassure our EU national employees that they are equally valued and appreciated members of our 10,000 strong workforce. As an employer, the Council is wholeheartedly committed to providing support to each and every member of staff who may be affected as the situation develops.

EU funding has brought hundreds of millions of pounds of assistance to the region over the past 40 years which has been critical to the region’s growth. The Council has taken every opportunity to work with partners to identify to the Scottish and UK Governments, the potential implications in Highland arising from BREXIT to ensure we have the right support in place to allow Highland to continue to thrive.

The Highland Council agreed key policy areas on which to lobby post BREXIT at its meeting in September. There is a need to ensure that Scottish and UK policy addresses the economic circumstances of Highland, to ensure that the challenges of living and working in the region are identified, and that the case for investment and support is made to enable the region to realise its full potential. In this context, the Council has agreed that regional policy; inward migration, access to markets and agriculture crofting and land management, are priority issues to be progressed.

In order to support the Council’s continued engagement and ensure the needs of our businesses and communities are recognised, a Brexit seminar is to be held on Friday 30 November at Council Headquarters. This will see discussion on potential impacts but also how these might be addressed with speakers from The University of Strathclyde, SCDI, SRUC, the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) and Scotland Europa.

Councillor Jimmy Gray, Administration lead for European matters, said:

“Discussions depend on good will between all parties and governments. This is a very complex subject which needs us all working together. There are a lot of partners involved, all with different priorities and we need to find some common ground. If we can have a clear voice on priorities across the Highlands and Islands, we have a better chance of success.”

Leader of the Highland Council, Margaret Davidson added:

“The risks are clear and the opportunities and positives are a lot less clear. My duty is to represent the Highlands, including those who voted for Brexit.

“We need to talk about a common regional policy and we need to be asking very clearly what we want to be devolved to a regional level. Since the administration of EU funding was centralised, this has been a disaster with funding unspent and long delays in distributing the funding. This illustrates the importance of devolving powers to regional level.”

Highland Council are seeking bids from organisations wishing to deliver activity as part of the UK Community Renewal Fund. The UK Community Renewal Fund is a pilot programme in advance of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund which is intended to replace EU funding.

Please read the UK Community Renewal Fund Prospectus and the UK Community Fund Technical Note for Project Applicants and Deliverers before starting work on a bid.

The Prospectus provides detailed information on the objectives of the Fund, the types of projects it intends to support and how it operates, including the process and selection criteria that will be used to assess bids.

To ensure the UK Community Renewal Fund reaches the places most in need, the UK Government has identified 100 priority places based on an index of economic resilience across Great Britain. While Highland has not been identified as one of these priority places, bids of a high quality may still be considered.

Successful UK Community Renewal Fund bids will be for 2021/22 only and activity must end by 31 March 2022.

Background

To help local areas prepare for the introduction of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund expected to commence April 2022 (more details expected Autumn 2021), the UK Government is providing funding in 2021/22 through the UK Community Renewal Fund. This is a competitive fund.

They are interested in bids that build on local insight and knowledge, and project proposals that align with long-term strategic plans for local growth, target people most in need and support community renewal.

A focus for this Fund is to support innovation and new ideas in these areas, investing in pilots that draw on local insights and which will help places to prepare for the introduction of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund in 2022.

Highland Council has been designated as a lead authority by the UK Government, with responsibility for:

issuing this invitation

receiving bids

selecting the bids that will be sent to UK Government for consideration

paying grants to successful projects and managing their performance

Full details of the role of lead authorities can be found in the UK Community Renewal Fund Prospectus

What type of bids are we looking for?

Projects must deliver activity that is line with the UK Community Renewal Fund Prospectus and align with at least one of these investment priorities:

Investment in skills - see section 3.2

Investment for local business - see section 3.3

Investment in communities and place - see section 3.4

Supporting people into employment - see section 3.5

There are no financial allocations to these priorities.

The UK Government anticipates supporting a range of projects by theme and size, but applicants are encouraged to maximise impact and deliverability through larger projects (£500,000+) where this is possible. For the Highland Council area, the minimum project value that will be considered is £50,000 bid.

As 90% of funding available through the UK Community Renewal Fund is revenue funding and only available in 2021/22, projects should be predominantly or exclusively revenue based.

Projects that focus predominantly on the construction or major refurbishment of buildings, the purchase of land or the purchase of large pieces of equipment are unlikely to be supported.

How bids will be assessed

Highland Council, as a lead authority designated by the UK Government, is expected to assess all bids submitted against:

the gateway criteria set out in the UK Community Renewal Fund Prospectus - bids that fail to meet these criteria are ineligible and will be rejected

the extent to which they meet the objectives of UK Community Renewal Fund

the extent to which bids would support local growth, target people most in need and support community renewal

This process is being refined however, following assessment, the Council will submit those eligible bids which most strongly meet the relevant criteria to the UK Government for consideration, up to a maximum of £3m, collectively.

The UK Government will assess all bids submitted by lead authorities against the criteria set out in the UK Community Renewal Fund Prospectus.

The UK Government will announce the outcome of the assessment process from late July 2021 onwards.

The Council will enter into a funding agreement with successful bidders.

Submitting a bid

Please read the UK Community Renewal Fund Prospectus and the UK Community Fund Technical Note for Project Applicants and Deliverers before starting work on a bid. The Prospectus provides detailed information on the objectives of the Fund, the types of projects it intends to support and how it operates, including the process and selection criteria that will be used to assess bids.

Bids must be submitted using the UK Community Renewal Fund Application Form. Bids submitted in any other format will not be accepted.

Bids must be submitted to Highland Council at regeneration@highland.gov.uk

This application process is now closed. Following initial assessment by Highland Council the UK Government will make a decision on successful applicants and advise from July 2021 onwards."

The UK’s withdrawal from the European Union will result in major changes in terms of how businesses are able to access the talent they need to succeed but Scottish Chambers of Commerce believes that there is an opportunity to design a new migration system, driven by economic need and responsive to the long term plans of businesses.

Liz Cameron, Chief Executive of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said:

At the moment, there are few certainties about what Brexit will mean for business but what we do know is that it will undoubtedly bring to an end the free movement of people between the UK and Europe that we have become so accustomed to. Migration was a major factor in the outcome of last year’s EU referendum and it seems that the UK is destined for a future where access to the UK to live and work will be regulated much more than it is today, particularly for European citizens.

However, in our view businesses should look upon this as an opportunity. The uncertainty and flux around Brexit gives us a unique opportunity to determine what the UK’s future migration priorities should look like. We believe that economic and business need must be the fundamental driver of future inward migration policy for the UK, enabling businesses to plan for the future, safe in the knowledge that government is backing them by targeting the skills that business needs to thrive and grow.

This policy should fully complement the efforts of the Scottish and UK Governments to ensure a steady supply of domestic talent from our schools, colleges and universities but should recognise that for many sectors, and across the full spectrum of skills levels, making full use of domestic talent can only ever be part of the solution.

The UK’s future use of the migration pipeline to channel talent into businesses where it is most needed would by definition be flexible, and able to address sectoral and geographical need, such as in Scotland’s digital and IT sector, where it is estimated that 11,000 new roles per year will need to be filled. It should also be able to respond to demographics. For example, Scotland’s projected population growth to 2024 is only 3.1%, compared to a projection of a 7.5% increase for England over the same period. Such a deficit, if unaddressed by migration, could have implications for Scotland’s ability to grow our economy and fund our public services.

It is time to make the case for a new migration system that works for the UK, works for Scotland and, above all, works for business. Free movement of people across Europe may have led us to become complacent about the effort that is required to target the talents that our businesses need across all sectors and all parts of the UK. We need to plan now for a system that will be focused on sourcing the right talent, wherever in the world that exists, and in the numbers that meet the demands of our economy."

The claim rests on the assumed identification of England and Wales with Britain, which identification, in our time of devolved governments and parliaments, surely cannot go unchallenged.

As a direct consequence of side-stepping all of these truths and considerations, the whole Brexit project being so eagerly promoted by Her Majesty’s Government and now by means of an early General Election, puts the integrity of the UK as a state at very serious risk: Brexit may very well come to mean Break-up.","voted, uk, serious, eu, wales, england, view, integrity, brexit, project, troubled, risk, remain, right, truth, puts","Writing in The Times newspaper on 5 May The Rt Rev Dr Gregor Duncan, Bishop of Glasgow & Galloway says:

“If it had not been for the people of England and Wales, the UK would not be leaving the EU. That may seem an eccentric way of stating the outcome of the EU referendum, but it is rather more than that because it denies legitimacy to the oft-repeated claim that “the British people” voted to leave the EU with its corollary that the UK Government must implement their will come what may. They did not, the people of England and Wales did. The claim rests on the assumed identification of England and Wales with Britain, which identification, in our time of devolved governments and parliaments, surely cannot go unchallenged.

“The truth is that only two parts of the four-part UK voted to leave the EU, not a majority at all from that point of view. There was no provision that for such a momentous change to be undertaken, a majority would have to exist in each constituent part of the UK and so no recognition of the increasingly diverse nature of this obviously troubled land, troubled by the inability of its largest constituent, England, to acknowledge and live comfortably within an entity greater than itself.

“The truth also is that those who voted to remain have as much right to have their view remain part of national discourse as the so-called Brexiteers have the right to pursue their aspirations. As a direct consequence of side-stepping all of these truths and considerations, the whole Brexit project being so eagerly promoted by Her Majesty’s Government and now by means of an early General Election, puts the integrity of the UK as a state at very serious risk: Brexit may very well come to mean Break-up.

“For all their talk of stability and of “coming together”, Mrs May and her ill-fated predecessor, who have made no secret of their devotion to all parts of the UK, have already done much to undermine it by giving in to UKIP and certain elements in their own party, so much so as to put their commitment to any interest beyond that of their own party’s prospects of office in doubt among some voters. One result may be that many Scots, who voted ‘No’ in 2014 and ‘Remain’ more recently, and who have perhaps never voted SNP will in the coming months sadly find themselves pondering with increasing distaste and disbelief the future mapped out for them by Mrs May, yoked to a Tory-dominated austerity England, and so increasingly unable to resist the demand for independence and for the end of the UK as they have known, loved and valued it all of their lives.”

The UK Treasury model includes some heroic assumptions about the speed at which Liam Fox's Department for International Trade could do deals with other countries. No other country has succeeded in striking so many deals so quickly.

An important point arising from the models, including the Scottish government and the Treasury, is that the effects change over time. So in Scotland, over the short to medium term, the first years would be mainly affected by trade and tariff barriers. But as businesses adjust to that, the role of net migration begins to have a more significant impact, and likewise productivity.

Lower net migration can be expected to reduce the rate of growth. And less inward investment means less of a contribution to productivity improvements from new processes and ideas coming in from abroad.

The St Andrew's House economists say that, by 2030, productivity would account for 60% of the difference in GDP between a ""no deal"" Brexit and EU membership, while migration would explain 26% of it. That leaves only 14% to be explained by the more obvious barriers to trade, such as tariffs.

And this assumes no change to the way the EU Single Market operates. If, for instance, Brussels deepens the integration of financial services, which it would like to do, that could have a big impact on growth within the EU over the next decade. It would widen the growth gap with the UK."

Today, at Holyrood, there is an intriguing question tabled by Mike Rumbles of the Liberal Democrats.","rumbles, russells, today, topic, 30, nicola, independence, brussels, seeking, holyrood, order, sturgeon","Then there is the related topic of independence. Nicola Sturgeon says she will raise the subject with the PM today - although Ms Sturgeon also adds, wryly, that she suspects Mrs May is already rather well appraised of the SNP's standpoint.

But is Ms Sturgeon about to make a move? Is she about to demand, once again, a Section 30 Order to transfer the power to Holyrood to hold a further referendum on Scottish independence?

Remember the history here. Westminster has control over the constitution under the Scotland Act 1998 which founded devolution.

A Section 30 order permits an additional power to be transferred, temporarily, to Holyrood in order to facilitate an agreed project. Just such an order was granted, by agreement, to enable the independence referendum in 2014 to take place.

Ms Sturgeon is very well aware of that. She did much of the detailed negotiation with the then Secretary of State Michael Moore in advance of the Edinburgh agreement signed by David Cameron and Alex Salmond.

On the 31st of March 2017, now as FM, Nicola Sturgeon wrote to the prime minister urging the instigation of further Section 30 talks. She later halted this process, saying she would return to the topic when there was clarity over Brexit.

That return is the moment we now await. Today, at Holyrood, there is an intriguing question tabled by Mike Rumbles of the Liberal Democrats.

Mr Rumbles, who frequently combines sagacity with mischief, is seeking to learn the Lord Advocate's view on whether the Scottish Government would have the competence to hold indyref2 - without a further Section 30 order.

I await the legal verdict eagerly. But I suspect Mr Rumbles already knows the political answer. Nicola Sturgeon's government would not sanction such a plebiscite.

They would regard it as unconstitutional, contrary to the strategy which the SNP has deployed of seeking to build independence from working to gain popular acquiescence, within the constraints of existing statute."

Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal.

This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up.

The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself.

Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border.

The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty.

Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days.

The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear.

Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain.

But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks."

His views have been backed up by the first minister, who - in a series of BBC interviews - has said SNP members would ""undoubtedly"" vote in favour of a fresh referendum.

Ms Sturgeon told the BBC's Scotland editor Sarah Smith: ""The reason I said SNP MPs will vote for another EU referendum - if that comes before the House of Commons I don't know whether it will - is if that opportunity presents itself, I don't think it would be right for us to stand in the way of people elsewhere in the UK getting the chance to change their minds and it would also, I think, be odd for us not to grasp an opportunity for Scotland to reaffirm its vote to remain in the EU.""

The aim was to agree what the government wanted from negotiations with the EU about the future relationship between the UK and the EU over Brexit. The plan that emerged from the meeting has become known as the Chequers plan, or sometimes simply Chequers.

The key aim of the plan is to create a free-trade area for goods moving between the EU and the UK while stopping freedom of movement for people between them.

To do this, the UK would commit to collecting import taxes, known as tariffs, on behalf of the EU for goods that arrive in the UK on their way to the EU. Meanwhile, goods that were staying in the UK could be charged at a different rate, depending on any future trade deals the UK agrees with other countries.

The UK would also agree to a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for manufactured goods and food, which would mean following EU rules and standards. In the future, if the EU changed any of its standards, the UK could decide not to follow those changes but at the risk of losing the free trade agreement for those goods.

The government believes the combination of the common rulebook and collecting tariffs for the EU would avoid the need for checks on goods passing between the UK and the EU, including over the Irish border.

However, the EU doesn't accept all proposals in the Chequers plan.

Ideally, the first minister would be looking for support for independence to rise perhaps to 60% and for that to be sustained and stable over many months before putting the question again. That doesn't seem likely in the short term. There hasn't been an indisputable ""post-Brexit bounce"" for the independence argument.

Where, opponents helpfully asked Mr Russell, would this leave Scotland? Unflustered but plainly under a little pressure, Mr Russell said that Wales must go its own course but that the two devolved nations would continue to work together.

Then caveat number two. There had been substantial expectation at the end of last week that there would be a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee (EU Negotiations) - JMC (EN) - today. And that it would herald a deal.

That speculation slowly died over the last 48 hours or so. What, those same helpful opponents inquired, had caused this? Had Mr Russell also been ready to deal - but been over-ruled by the first minister?

Mr Russell was repeatedly asked for his view on this. With comparable frequency, he issued a denial, at one point confining his answer to the single word ""No"".

Indeed, he had sought to pre-empt such challenges by insisting in his statement that the Scottish government had been ""absolutely and unanimously clear"" about the need to preserve the principle of devolution.

So where are we now? We have learned that the Welsh have struck a deal. We will learn more from the UK government as to how they intend to proceed.

Mr Russell, meanwhile, is advancing two possible solutions. One, drop Clause 11 (the bit of the Bill which deals with devolved powers) - while penning a written agreement between Edinburgh and London that the two governments will not legislate in these returning areas while the frameworks are built.

Two, stick to the present system of rules and regulations - while agreeing constraint on any legislation north or south of the border; in essence, that both would require mutual consent.

The minister characterised these as ""practical and workable"" solutions. There are of course alternatives.

There may yet be a deal between Edinburgh and London which would permit the Scottish Parliament to consent to a revised bill in Westminster. In reality, the deadline for this is mid-May, prior to Third Reading in the Lords.

That would mean Holyrood drops the Continuity Bill, allowing these powers to be written into Scots Law. You will remember that bill is now the subject of a UK government challenge in the Supreme Court.

Or there could be no deal. And the Continuity Bill is upheld by the Supreme Court allowing Holyrood to proceed.

Or there could be no deal. The Continuity Bill could be struck down. And Westminster could use its sovereign powers to legislate for the whole of the UK, without Holyrood consent."

As I write the long and rather enjoyable spell of warm, sunny and blue-skied days appears to be coming to an end. The weather has certainly been a major topic of conversation over the past few weeks as we moved from what appeared to be January 109th into summer climes more common on the continent than here.

In almost 42 years living in the north east of Scotland I cannot recall so prolonged a period of fine weather and must confess to having enjoyed it – enjoyment increased by visiting Edinburgh recently for the Scottish Land and Estates Spring Conference and seeing our capital city in mist and haar…oh dear.

The theme of the Conference was Brexit, with a range of excellent speakers discussing different aspects of the situation and the possible impacts for land managers.

Whilst huge uncertainty over the future, over agricultural policy, the support regime post-Brexit, questions over environmental policy and the availability of labour within the sector dominated discussion, there were a few voices expressing greater confidence. I have to say these were very much in the minority.

The importance to our economy of the food sector – including agriculture – was also well emphasised, with one speaker saying that 1:8 of the UK population is involved in food manufacturing and the supply chain.

What is absolutely beyond question is that leaving the EU will lead to profound changes within the land management sector; what those changes will be and exactly what impact they will have is unknown and that uncertainty is weighing heavily.

The long dry spell since January 109th has of course increased the risk of wild fire across Scotland and there have been a number of incidents, within the Park and elsewhere.

I was very concerned to see that a wild fire- rapidly dealt with by the Fire and Rescue teams and others fortunately – on the Muir of Dinnet NNR in Aberdeenshire was very probably caused by a disposable barbeque.

It is timely to think about the use of these in the countryside and the very real risks they pose, either in use of by being disposed of carelessly. When conditions are as dry as they are at the moment, the chances of wildfire and massive damage to our environment are greatly increased. I would urge everyone to be cautious in their use.

And finally I must mention the heroic achievement of our Head of Land Management Will Boyd-Wallis who has become (probably) the first person to make a solo navigation of the boundaries of the Park.

Will took 22 days to walk the 270 miles, much of it across pathless landscapes, through both mist and sunshine. A tremendous achievement. Thus far Will has raised some £8000 for the Cure Parkinson’s Trust, well on the way to his target for the venture. On behalf of everyone at the CNPA I would congratulate Will and look forward to hearing more about his journey.

1918 was such a pivotal year in world history that it is difficult, a century later, not to reflect on the hundred years that have passed since then. For folk living in the Strath, there must have been intense weariness over a war that surely seemed endless, anxiety over those caught up in it and grief for those who had already fallen. It will be interesting to see how the 11th November 2018 will be marked.

2018 also marks 15 years since the Cairngorms National Park came into being, an occasion that was marked by a ceremony at the Ptarmigan on Cairngorm Mountain. It was, I recall, a day of low cloud and minimal visibility until, a few moments after the conclusion of the minister’s speech, the skies cleared and the view down to Loch Morlich and beyond opened up. Whether this was an omen I shall leave for others to determine but there is certainly no doubt in my mind that the Park and the communities within it have come on a long way since then.

Which is not to say that everyone agrees with everything that the CNPA has done or everything we are setting out to achieve. It would be a dull world if that were so. There are challenges ahead and no doubt much debate over how to address them; I look forward to that debate for none of us have a monopoly on wisdom.

I am also looking forward to seeing the completion of the extension to the CNPA offices in Grantown; this will give much better working conditions for our staff, better access for everyone and better facilities for meetings. I was pleased that after competitive tendering the contract for the work was awarded to a local builder and it is good to see the real progress that is being made.

A good deal of work will be done this year in preparation for the EUROPARC Conference in September. I cannot emphasise enough what a massive opportunity this will be for the Park and businesses within it. We are expecting over 300 delegates, including young people, all of whom are keenly interested in ‘the outdoors’, in national parks and protected areas, and many of whom will be coming to the Cairngorms for the first time.

2018 is the Year of Young People and that will be reflected in the debates and discussion at the conference as well as in our work throughout the year.

The major consultation for 2018 will be the next Local Development Plan, a key document that will set out how development will take place across the Park. It is vital that as many people as possible get involved in this consultation; this is the best opportunity to have an influence on the planning process locally, to have a say on the ‘rules’ before the ‘rules’ are fixed.

And finally, I suspect that 2018 will see some focus on Brexit, on any outcome of the negotiations and the impact the whole process will have on our economy, our relations with Europe, the future prospects for the many EU citizens who have made such a contribution to the Park, particularly in tourism and hospitality and all the other countless issues that have yet to be resolved.

But there is little the CNPA can do to influence that! So I shall end by wishing everyone a very happy, healthy and successful New Year."

There can be no doubt about the importance of tourism to the economy of the Cairngorms National Park and equally no doubt as to the attractiveness of our landscapes, nature and culture to visitors. And whilst, as with almost everything in the modern world, Tourism is in a state of almost constant change – driven in no small measure by new technologies – there are nonetheless fundamentals that do not change.

The evidence clearly demonstrates that many visitors, particularly those from overseas, come to the Park because it is a National Park. This vital status is recognised world-wide as an indicator of somewhere special; not a marketing ploy but a recognition of the genuinely world-class environment in the widest sense. That we are a National Park is a hugely important part of our visitors’ decision-making.

And we know too that they are not disappointed. The Visitor Survey of a couple of years back amply demonstrated that visitors coming here for the first time come with very high expectations but leave with those expectations exceeded; the Cairngorms National Park was even better than they thought and dreamed it would be.

This for me was the stand-out statistic from the survey but it is also one that puts a burden on all of us who are in some way or another involved in Tourism within the Park. I would suggest that that includes everyone who lives and works here, not just those operating Tourism businesses or services. We all have a part to play. It includes the person who takes time to give a visitor directions. It includes the approach of the folk behind the counters in petrol stations or shops every bit as much as folk working in Tourist Information Centres.

Looking back to my first period of the CNPA, back in 2003 and the visits the new Board made around the Park, I have no hesitation in saying that the whole approach to visitors, the entire tourism offering within the park has improved massively and this can only be to the benefit of all.

Which is not to say there are not challenges ahead. The subject of Tourism cannot be discussed without the matter of broadband being raised within seconds. There are still gaps in the infrastructure needing to be filled. Travel, by means other than a private car, leaves much to be desired. And looming behind all of this, the whole question of Brexit and the impact it will, may or could have on the whole sector. The only certainty on that score as I write is that nothing is certain and that uncertainty is extraordinarily unhelpful for businesses within the Park as they plan ahead.

But the rocks and the mountains remain. Tourists and visitors have been coming here since the days when it was realised that mountains and wild lands are beautiful. The details may change. The technologies change all the time, along with our approach, the way we travel, dress, talk and think. But the Cairngorms remain, giving us all an incomparable asset and of course an unparalleled duty – I won’t say burden."

And so it has come to pass. What many thought was unthinkable has happened. The UK will leave the European Union. Many questions still remain unanswered in the heady days after the momentous vote on Thursday last week, not least the role of the UK’s devolved regions in all of this.

The day after the vote, and shortly after the Prime Minister David Cameron had announced his resignation, Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party and First Minister of Scotland gave a confident stateswomenlike speech. Quoting from the SNP’s manifesto of last month’s Scottish Parliamentary elections she stated that where a majority of the UK voted to leave the EU but a majority of Scotland voted to stay, that this would constitute the ‘material change in circumstances’ which would trigger a new independence referendum. The fact that Scotland voted by 62% to stay in the EU whereas the UK as a whole voted by 52% to leave, mean, she said, that a second Scottish Independence Referendum was firmly back on the agenda again.

On Sunday morning, she further noted in an interview with the BBC, that she would veto any attempt by a future British government to effect the withdrawal of the UK from the EU following the referendum result. This has raised a flurry of questioning of whether this is actually constitutionally permissible.

In this blogpost I will argue why I think it is; that is that the Scottish Parliament does, constitutionally, have the power to use the constitution to attempt to veto an attempt by a British government to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union.

Legislative Consent Motions

Firstly, a brief primer on the constitutional relationship between the British and Scottish Parliaments. The Scottish Parliament was established by an Act of the Westminster parliament, the Scotland Act 1998, but the main constitutional mechanism regulating this relationship is the Sewell convention (named after the Parliamentarian who announced the policy during the passage of the Scotland Act 1998). This Convention was recently codified in (another) Scotland Act in 2016 which formulates the convention in the following way:

‘it is recognized that the Parliament of the United Kingdom will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish Parliament’

As such, the convention provides that Westminster will, all things being equal, request the permission of the Scottish Parliament to pass legislation on issues on which the Scottish Parliament has competence. This ‘permission’ takes the form of a Legislative Consent Motion (LCM) of the Scottish parliament as a means of endorsing legislation from the UK Parliament which affects an area of policy that has been devolved.

Whereas this has been interpreted as relating exclusively to legislating on matters under the competence of the Scottish Parliament at any particular time,[1] it now seems clear that it also extends to the modification of the powers of the devolved institutions through amendments to the Scotland Act.[2] That is, any attempt to vary the powers of the Scottish Parliament, whether to restrict or augment its legislative or administrative powers, requires the permission of the Scottish Parliament in the form of a Legislative Consent Motion. The invocation of the convention during the passage of the Scotland Act 2012 arguably confirms this position.

Of course, notwithstanding the existence of the Sewell Convention applying to the relationship between the two legislatures, under the British constitution it remains a convention not a formal rule of positive law. That is that it is a norm of political understanding between the parliaments rather than a legally enforceable rule. It is clear that the Westminster Parliament retains the power, in law to legislate on areas over which the Scottish Parliament has competence and can ignore the protestations of a Scottish Parliament to give effect to EU withdrawal. An aggrieved Scottish parliament would have no recourse to the courts to air their grievance; generally speaking a court will not entertain an action based on breach of a convention as it is not generally considered a rule of formal constitutional law.

It is political enforcement which gives the convention its bite such that any attempt by the Westminster parliament to act in breach of the convention would have significant political ramifications; potentially sparking a constitutional crisis. As such the ‘veto’ is consequential rather than normative, that is it is a threat to spark a constitutional crisis, rather than a power to formally legally stop Brexit, which is at stake.

The Sewel Convention and EU Law

There are two ways in which the Sewell convention is implicated in the question of the UK’s departure from the EU: 1) Relating to the EU law-related powers in the Scotland Act 1998 based on the European Communities Act 1972 and 2) EU law-related powers under the definition of ‘EU law’ contained in the Scotland Act 1998.

The European Communities Act 1972

The European Communities Act 1972 (ECA) is the legal measure which essentially gives effect to the UK’s EU Membership. It is the portal through which the vast amount of EU law is recognised and enforced within the UK as well as providing for its direct effect and for the jurisdiction of the EU courts. Whereas the most significant powers contained in the ECA are within the exclusive competence of the Westminster Parliament, some of the powers under the ECA have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament to ensure the uniform implementation of EU law. In particular:

the powers of the Scottish government to observe and implement EU law through executive powers,

the duty of Scottish government to have regard to the objectives of the EU when exercising powers granted by an Act of the Scottish Parliament

the power of the Parliament to annul the exercise of statutory powers by the Scottish government for failure to have regard to the objectives of the EU

Even if the devolved powers of the ECA are relatively limited, a repeal of the ECA to give legal effect to Brexit would trigger the Sewell convention given the way the ECA is embedded in the Scotland Act in the devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament.

Firstly, the power of Scottish ministers to implement EU law and the powers of the Scottish parliament to annul orders of Scottish ministers interpreting EU law rely on interpretations of the ECA. Repealing the ECA without subsequently amending the Scotland Act would mean that the administrative powers devolved to the Scottish government would be powers stemming from an Act which was not longer in force. This would potentially have the result of

depriving the Scottish government of the power to implement EU law,

creating a more general power of Scottish ministers to exercise their powers under Acts of the Scottish Parliament, released from a duty to have regard to the objectives of the EU in so exercising

depriving the Parliament to annul such exercise for failure for having regard to the objectives of EU law.

Alternatively, the non-existence of the Act from which the powers stemmed would result in an augmentation of those powers in the Scotland Act as they would no longer be constrained by the conditions on the exercise of those powers contained in the (repealed) ECA. Either way, unilaterally repealing the ECA without subsequently amending the Scotland Act would simultaneously restrict and augment the powers of the Scottish Parliament thereby triggering the convention.

Secondly, given that the Scottish Parliament is currently prohibited from doing certain things involving EU law as these are explicitly the competence of the Westminster parliament (for example determining the effects of EU law in the UK and determining the jurisdiction of the EU courts in the UK), a repeal of the ECA to give effect to Brexit would allow the Scottish parliament to do things it was previously unable to do as the Act containing the prohibitions would cease to exist. Even if the subsequent ‘knock-on’ amendments were not made to the Scotland Act to take account of this, this would be a potentially large increase in the powers of the Scottish Parliament, again triggering the Convention.[3]

EU law related powers under the notion of ‘EU law’ embedded in the Scotland Act 1998.

The other main EU law relevant question of the competences of the devolved institutions relates to definition of EU law within the Scotland Act itself. The Scotland Act deprives the competence of the devolved institutions to violate EU law stating that any such act which purports to do so is simply ‘not law’. In the Scotland Act, ‘EU law’ is defined in s. 126(9) as ‘all those rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions from time to time created or arising by or under the EU Treaties’, and ‘all those remedies and procedures from time to time provided for by or under the EU Treaties’. Although this wording is clearly taken from s. 2(1) ECA, no reference is made to the Act in defining EU law for the purposes of the Scotland Act. (This can be contrasted with the case of ‘Convention rights’ under the Scotland Act which explicitly rely on the Human Rights Act 1998 for their meaning under s. 126(1) SA.) This has the effect of giving the term ‘EU law’, and the obligations stemming thereunder an autonomous meaning, for the purposes of the application of the (non-ECA based parts of) the Scotland Act. As such, EU law has effects vis-à-vis the activities of the devolved institutions independently of the ECA.

Were the UK to repeal the ECA to give effect to Brexit, it would require fresh legislation specifically amending the Scotland Act in order for Scotland to ‘leave’ the EU as it were, given that EU law has an autonomous meaning within the SA. This could provide clear grounds for triggering the Convention.

First of all, alongside the specific transfer of executive competences to implement EU law through the provisions of the ECA discussed above, the Scotland Act arguably also contains a more general non-ECA related power to implement EU law stemming from the provisions of the Scotland Act itself and in particular its autonomous definition of EU law. This can be read into para. 7 of Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act which explicitly states that that the observation and implementation of EU law (autonomously defined in the SA itself) is not a reserved matter. As such, both the Parliament and Executive have the competence to observe and implement EU law within their devolved competences, which relates directly to the provisions of the EU treaties themselves through the autonomous definition in s. 126 SA rather than being channelled through the ECA.

Secondly, legislation would be required to amend the Scotland Act to relieve the devolved institutions from the obligation to respect EU law to give effect to Brexit. Repealing the ECA would not be enough. This would remove a significant encumbrance on the legislative and executive competence of the devolved institutions in that they would then be free to violate EU law and would therefore constitute a major augmentation of the competences of the devolved institutions thereby triggering the convention.

Of course, Nicola Sturgeon will not veto Brexit legislation of the UK Parliament purely for its own sake. She will probably try to use a potential veto as leverage for something she wants. The most obvious candidate issue here is a second independence referendum. Constitutionally speaking, she needs the permission of British parliament to hold a second independence referendum following the precedent in the transfer of powers from Westminster to Edinburgh which paved the way for the 2014 independence referendum. It is arguable, then, that this will become a useful bargaining chip in the ensuing debate about the UK’s future in Europe and Scotland’s future in the UK and Europe. The constitutional position, however, means that the UK government can ignore Scotland’s veto, repeal the ECA and amend the Scotland Act to give effect to withdrawal of the EU. This would be constitutionally permissible but politically highly risky. In the febrile political atmosphere from the resulting constitutional crisis, Scotland could make a unilateral declaration of independence. What would happen then is anyone’s guess.

Looking back on the result of the Brexit vote, future historians may well conclude that the post-WW II United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was, like Belgium, held together by the European Union.

Flanders and Wallonia dare not split into independent countries (despite decades of mutual antipathy and non-co-operation) because neither wishes to lose Brussels as its capital. But London does not hold the UK together. The Brexit vote revealed the vast gulf in social attitudes and political aspirations between London and the rest of England. The encircling M25 haloes and isolates London, just as the medieval palisade separated pre-Tudor Dublin from “Irish” Ireland. L’Angleterre profonde now lies beyond the Pale, and London as an international city state in waiting is profoundly out of sympathy and out of step with it.

How to be Unionist

Meanwhile, north of Hadrian’s Wall, a different politics flourishes in which London, and the rest of England, appear increasingly irrelevant. The SNP now run a minority administration from Edinburgh, largely as a result of the remarkable resurrection of the Tory vote under the leadership of Ruth Davidson MSP and the continued collapse of the Labour vote under the leadership of Kezia Dugdale MSP. But the Scottish Tories keep their distance from their sister party to the south and contemplate, as part of their on-going de-toxification, dropping the label “Conservative” and returning to their pre-1965 designation as the Scottish Unionists. And Scottish Labour sinks into yet deeper irrelevance, while flirting with talk of a post-Brexit complete federalisation of the UK.

In his speech on 14 September 2014 following the result of the Scottish independence referendum (in which one of the claims made by those advocating the status quo was that only by voting to stay in the UK could Scotland ensure that it remained within the EU) the then UK Prime Minister David Cameron proclaimed that he was “a passionate believer in our United Kingdom” and that he “wanted more than anything that our Union stay together”. And in her 13 July 2016 acceptance speech on succeeding him as UK Prime Minister Theresa May noted that

“The full title of my party is the Conservative and Unionist Party. And that word unionist is very important to me. It means we believe in the union, the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.”

But just what makes this bond so doubly “precious” and why it should be the object of “passionate belief” has not been further developed. It is not clear that this is, in any event, a sentiment that is shared in l’Angleterre profonde by whose votes the Conservative party won its unexpected majority in the House of Commons in May 2015. The Conservative successful general election campaign was marked by dog-whistle anti-Caledonian insinuations that a vote for the Labour Party meant a vote for the SNP in coalition with it, putting “sad Ed” Miliband into the pockets of “smart Alec” Salmond and “tricky Nicky” Sturgeon.

As the distinct polities which make up the still nominally United Kingdom grow ever further apart, the only solution which appears to be offered is the delegation – but never the complete transfer – of more powers to the English regions and to the non-English nations. This might be termed disintegrative devolution.

But the shibboleth of sovereignty means that power is never unequivocally divested from Westminster. Powers devolved are powers retained. Thus when it comes to the (Brexit) crunch from a Westminster perspective, while the devolved legislatures and executives may properly expect to be consulted on and advised of negotiations, they cannot expect to participate in them. And they are certainly not regarded as having any power to prevent either the UK as a whole, or any of its constituent parts, from leaving the EU, notwithstanding that in the Brexit referendum (in which UK resident Commonwealth and Irish citizens, but not other EU citizens, had a vote) Scotland voted 62% in favour of remaining in the EU against 38% for leaving it, while the vote in Northern Ireland was 56% for remain and 42% for leave.

Honest Broker

Unlike Westminster, the devolved legislatures are elected on the basis of a franchise which gives the vote to citizens of other EU member states lawfully resident in their territories. The devolved executives may therefore properly claim to have obtained a democratic mandate from, and be democratically accountable, to these EU citizens; and may plausibly claim to have the constitutional duty to represent and give voice to those individuals’ concerns and claims. But the fact that EU citizens currently lawfully resident in the UK are mentioned both by the Prime Minister and by her newly appointed Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis MP, only in the context of their possible use as human shields or bargaining counters in the Brexit negotiations rather indicates that the little Englander politics of the “nasty party” have not been wholly abandoned under this new UK premiership.

Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) states that in the negotiations and conclusion of an agreement setting out the arrangements for a Member State’s withdrawal from the EU, account has to be taken of the framework for that State’s “future relationship with the Union”. The fact that the majority of the Scottish electorate voted to remain in the EU, that the Scottish Parliament is electorally answerable to EU citizens resident in Scotland, that the party forming the current Scottish administration completely dominates in terms of the electoral representation of Scotland in Westminster, all combine to put the current Scottish Government in a strong position to present itself to the other EU Member States (and to the Commission) as the only honest broker, seeking in good faith to facilitate a settlement between the UK Government and the rest of the EU which recognises and preserves the rights of EU citizens settled here, and the rights of Britons who have exercised their free movement rights to live elsewhere in the EU.

As I have written in earlier posts, the least-worst way of achieving that end is for the UK to leave the EU, to re-join EFTA and, in that capacity, to sign up to the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement. Although it was originally envisaged to be a transitional arrangement for European States preparing their populations for full EU membership, the half-way house of becoming an EFTA-EEA state has proved to be surprisingly resilient. While EFTA-EEA states are bound by the original four freedoms of the Treaty of Rome – goods, services, workers (not citizens) and capital – and by its competition law and State aid rules, they are not subject to oversight by the Commission, the Council or the European Parliament, nor are they under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, nor are they bound to give effect to afford EU law direct effect in, and primacy, over domestic law. Becoming an EFTA-EEA state would mean that the UK exited the EU’s Common Agriculture and Fisheries Policies, Justice and Home Affairs, Common Foreign and Security Policy, Taxation harmonisation, Monetary Union, Customs Union, and Common Trade Policy. Coming out of the EU common trade policy would means that the UK could seek to negotiate and conclude free trade agreements directly with other non-EU states, without the involvement of the European Commission.

The EFTA-EEA Scenario

For the UK to re-join EFTA would need the agreement of all its current members: Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. To sign up to the EEA Agreement and become an EFTA-EEA state would however require the agreement of the three other EFTA-EEA – Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein – as well as the EU and all its Member States (the EEA agreement being in EU law terms a “mixed agreement” for which competence is shared between the EU and its constituent Member States). Norway, in particular, may well be concerned that the UK’s becoming a fourth EFTA-EEA state would de-stabilise the whole arrangement and eclipse Norwegian influence. One way of calming Norwegian fears about “perfidious Albion” might well be to make provision to allow for the UK’s status as an EFTA-EEA State to be in the first instance on a provisional basis, with say a break point in 5 years at which point all parties can re-assess matters and determine whether to continue with it. It may be that after 5 years of negotiating free trade deals with non-EU states, the UK would be happy to go it alone outside the EEA. It might find that, politically and economically, it suits the UK – and all the other contracting parties to the EEA agreement – for it to remain as an EFTA-EEA state. It might be that after 5 years in the EEA the UK asks, as envisaged by Article 50(5) TEU, to re-join a doubtless reformed and chastened EU. The point about this break point is that it allows all parties a secure transitional phase under existing rules and supervisory structures and gives time to take stock while maintaining economic stability for both the UK and Europe as a whole.

The prize for a nationalist Scottish administration brokering what might be termed a five year EFTA-EEA “naughty step” membership for the UK is that in this period, Scotland can take the time to cultivate its own international relations, particularly with Norway, Iceland and Ireland as well as with the rest of the EU member states and the EU institutions. This might be done with a view to negotiating and agreeing among all relevant parties for Scotland to become itself an independent EFTA-EEA state at the end of the five year transitional period for the UK in the EEA. The advantage to its becoming an independent EFTA-EEA membership is that Scotland would not be committed to joining the Euro under such an arrangement. Spain too could be reassured – and unlikely to exercise its veto – on Scotland becoming an EFTA-EEA state, since this would not set any kind of precedent for the secession of Catalonia with a view to it becoming a new member State of the EU in addition to Spain. But once established as an EFTA-EEA member State Scotland would, if so minded, then be in a position to open negotiations to re-join the EU since it would then fulfil the requirements of Article 49 TEU as a “European State which respects the values referred to in Article 2 TEU and is committed to promoting them”.

As a matter of public international law, these negotiations can be conducted and binding agreements concluded while Scotland remains part of the UK, because public international law recognises that bodies other than independent States can enter into binding international Treaties, provided that this is within their competence as a matter of national law. For example Article 32(3) of the German Basic Law, the Grundgesetz states that “insofar as the Länder have power to legislate, they may conclude treaties with foreign states with the consent of the Federal Government”. One example of such an international Treaty is the 1960 Steckborn Convention concluded between the Land of Baden-Württemberg, the Free State of Bavaria, the Republic of Austria and the Swiss Confederation on the protection of Lake Constance against pollution. EU law itself already makes express provision in Regulation 1082/2006 for the creation by regional and local authorities within the Member States of “European Groupings of Territorial Co-operation (EGTC) which are transnational bodies with legal personality created to facilitate territorial co-operation with other bodies in other Member States and/or with neighbouring overseas countries or territories associated with the EU (OCTs) and/or with neighbouring third countries outside the EU (“neighbouring” being defined in Article 3a(1) as including sharing a common land border or facing a common sea basin).

The return of national responsibility for the conservation of fishing resources within the North Sea consequent upon the UK leaving the EU but joining EFTA (with a view to it becoming an EFTA-EEA state) might well provide an opportunity for Scotland immediately to enter into international agreements directly with Norway and/or Iceland on these issues, as well as on issues of environmental and energy policy associated with oil and gas extraction in the North Sea. As a matter of domestic law this might require some amendment of the Scotland Act 1998 since while Paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 devolves “observing and implementing international obligations” to Scotland paragraph 7(1) reserves to Westminster “international relations, including relations with territories outside the United Kingdom, the European Union (and their institutions) and other international organisations, regulation of international trade, and international development assistance and co-operation”. There would also have to be clear re-definition of the sea-waters recognised by the UK to be under (devolved) Scottish control.

Border Issues

Separately, Scotland as (part of) an EFTA-EEA state might seek to conclude or be party to agreements or memorandums of understanding directly with Ireland in relation to the status of Northern Ireland in the event of Scottish independence from the rest of the UK. In such a scenario the problem for the unionist population of Northern Ireland would be that there would no longer be a Britain to which they could cleave; they could no longer claim to be British but instead would simply be a faithful remnant of remaining citizens of a formerly United Crown and Kingdom. It may be that a vote for Scottish independence could be agreed to trigger a referendum in Northern Ireland which might have three questions as follows: (1) in the event of Scottish independence do you wish Northern Ireland to remain in union with England and Wales ? If, and only if, less than 50% vote for this option, then the following subsidiary question might arise: if Northern Ireland is not to remain in union with England and Wales do you wish it to (2) go into union with Ireland ? or (3) go into union with Scotland ? Scotland might thereby be seen to be shouldering responsibility for the historic legacy of its king James VI and I’s successful scheme to drive a dividing wedge between the Romanist Scottish and Irish Gaeltachts by the Plantation of Ulster with English speaking Protestant lowland Scots loyal to his Crown. As ever with our constitution, we need to go back to find the future.

The problem in all this is the attitude that the UK Government might take. At the moment Theresa May says she is committed to the maintenance of a “soft border” between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland even once the UK ceases to be an EU member state. This could only be done, however if the UK entered into a customs union with the EU and agreed to maintaining the free movement of goods. But a common travel area across the island of Ireland could no longer extend throughout the territory of the UK if a post-Brexit UK repudiates EU free movement law. In effect, the price of maintaining a soft border for the six counties of Northern Ireland would be to translate that into a less permeable border, now situated within the Irish Sea, by the re-introduction of security entry controls (such as were maintained during the Troubles). In the event of Scottish independence this semi-permeable border would be transferred to the line between Carlisle and Berwick upon Tweed.

All these matters might of course be the subject of specific legal agreement among the now independent nations of the Anglo-Celtic Archipelago (ACA, formerly the British Isles) to be policed by a new international tribunal for the formerly United Crown and Kingdom (modelled perhaps on the current UKSC/JCPC but with the introduction of judges from Ireland as well as from Scotland, England Wales and Northern Ireland). This new court – which might be termed the Anglo Celtic Tribunal (ACT) – could assist in ensuring not only that the terms of any Anglo Celtic Agreement were duly adhered to but also, perhaps, have a role in ensuring a common standard of protection of fundamental rights across the nations of the home islands."

An Independent Scotland, Europe, and the Law

When Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom on 18 September 2014, many people thought that the question of Scottish independence had been settled for at least a generation. The EU referendum of 23 June 2016, where 62% of Scottish voters opted to remain in the EU, but 51% of the overall UK electorate voted to leave, changed this perception. In the words of the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, another independence referendum was ‘firmly back on the table’.

Indeed, on Monday she announced that she would ask the Scottish Parliament to allow her to agree with the UK Government on another independence referendum. The Scottish people should be given a right to decide – once the terms of Brexit are known – whether to stick with the UK and leave the EU or pursue the route of independence and stay within ‘Europe’.

This blog post will briefly outline some of the legal obstacles on the way, both internal and external.

The internal dimension

Internally, mirroring the procedure resulting in the 2014 vote, the Scottish Government will seek an Order in Council under section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998. The section 30 order would grant the Scottish Parliament the powers under the UK devolution settlement to call another independence referendum. According to schedule 7 of the Scotland Act, such an order must be approved by a resolution of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords as well as by the Scottish Parliament.

This means that the Scottish Government would need the backing of the UK Government and Parliament for such a move. Whether this backing is forthcoming is currently unclear. What is politically important, however, is that Sturgeon has kicked the ball firmly into Westminster’s court. If Westminster refuses to grant another referendum, this may cause resentment in Scotland (the Scottish nationalists will certainly interpret a refusal as another piece of evidence that Scotland’s wishes are being ignored); if Westminster concedes, there is a real risk of the UK’s Union breaking up given that a recent poll produced a 50-50 tie between supporters and opponents of independence.

Once a section 30 order has been adopted, the Scottish Parliament would need to legislate on the exact ramifications of a referendum. Nicola Sturgeon suggested that the date should be towards the end of the Brexit negotiation process, which means some time between the autumn of 2018 and the spring of 2019. Moreover, that legislation would also need to determine the franchise. In 2014 the electorate was identical with that of the Scottish Parliament elections plus young voters under 16. This includes EU citizens, who might become an important factor in this referendum.

The external dimension

Sturgeon’s announcement to ask for another independence vote only makes sense before the backdrop of Brexit. The pro-independence camp will want to present voters with a choice between staying part of ‘Brexit Britain’ and an independent Scotland remaining in ‘Europe’.

The UK Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to initiate the process of leaving the EU this week, which would result in the UK leaving the EU in March 2019 after the two-year period for negotiations foreseen by Article 50 TEU has expired. If the negotiations go well, Brexit will result in a withdrawal agreement. According to the Government’s plans, the UK will leave the single market and thus abandon free movement of people. Its aim will be to conclude a free trade agreement with the UK, probably negotiated during a transitional period of three to five years. If the negotiations fail, the UK will leave the EU in March 2019 without a deal. Trade will revert to WTO rules.

As Kirsty Hughes and I argued in another blog post, it would take Scotland some time after an independence vote to extricate itself from the UK. This means that if an independence referendum were held in autumn 2018 or in early 2019, Scotland would leave the EU together with the UK even if such a referendum yielded a ‘yes’ result.

Scotland would thus have to apply for EU membership from outside on the basis of Article 49 TEU. It would need to fulfil the usual accession requirements, in particular adoption of the EU acquis and participation in the Economic and Monetary Union. In theory, Scotland would also need to commit to becoming part of the Schengen area, but it might be successful in negotiating an opt-out from this given the long-standing Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland, which could in the future include an independent Scotland. Accession could be negotiated relatively quickly given that Scotland currently complies with much of the EU acquis. Nonetheless, a transitional arrangement – such as temporary membership of the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) and the European Economic Area (EEA) – would be necessary to ensure that Scotland stays within the single market.

Interestingly, Nicola Sturgeon’s speech does not commit an independent Scotland to EU membership. She might therefore decide to campaign for an independent Scotland in the single market as a member of EFTA/EEA rather than in the EU. Aiming for EFTA/EEA membership would have the advantage of pre-empting some difficult arguments against independence: it would neither commit Scotland to adopt the Euro, nor to take part in the EU’s common fisheries policy – an emotive issue in Scotland.

Moreover, it would potentially make trade between Scotland and rest of the UK (rUK) easier to manage. The volume of that trade is reported to be four times greater than between Scotland and the EU. In contrast to EU membership, EFTA/EEA membership does not prevent member states from having free trade arrangements with third countries (i.e. the rUK). If the rUK’s relationship with the EU is either on WTO terms (in case of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal) or based on a relatively basic free trade deal, Scotland would be able to come to a better arrangement with rUK. Whether Scotland could remain in a customs union with rUK – as proposed in the Scottish Government’s paper ‘Scotland’s Place in Europe’ released in December – would depend on whether current EFTA/EEA countries would insist on Scotland committing to sign up to EFTA’s 27 free trade deals with third countries. This is a requirement found in Article 56 (3) of the EFTA Convention.

In any event the border between Scotland and rUK would become a trade border, even if only for the purpose of checking the correctness of declarations of origin (detailed comments can be found here). However, if Scotland and rUK continued to be part of the Common Travel Area immigration checks at the border could be avoided. Indeed, a future Scottish-rUK relationship could envisage free movement of people between the two.

Conclusion

Nicola Sturgeon’s call for another Scottish independence referendum has added even more complexity to the Brexit mix. It is difficult to gauge how an intense Scottish independence campaign fought in parallel to the UK’s Brexit negotiations would affect the UK’s negotiating position. Would the UK aim for a softer Brexit in order to make staying part of the UK more attractive to wavering Scottish voters? Or would it aim for an even harder break with the EU than currently envisaged and try to create enough anti-EU resentment in Scotland to sway voters to stay with the UK? Or will Westminster simply try to sit it out and promise another referendum well after Brexit is done and dusted? These are probably some of the questions pondered in Whitehall"

Straight answers to straight questions: lessons from the Scottish referendum

1. In December 2014 I wrote a blog post entitled A tale of two referendums. The piece was written in the light of the September 2014 Scottish independence referendum and the year-long campaign which had preceded it. That experience had left me very sceptical about the wisdom and utility of referendums as a means of illuminating and resolving constitutional questions. I wrote:

“ . . . referendums are no way to conduct politics in any mature multi-party Parliamentary democracy. They do not, after all, give straight answers to straight questions. Their very calling may be the result of political manipulation, and their results remain subject to radical political re-interpretation. They necessarily misrepresent difficult and complex political issues by reducing matters down to but one question, which can only be answered yes or no. They require certainty and finality in the face of the uncertain and the unknown. They do not allow for a multiplicity of voices or viewpoints. They leave no space for compromise. Information and properly informed discussion is lost in their barrage of unverifiable claims and unfalsifiable counter claims as to what the future holds from each opposing side in any referendum battle.”

2. I predicted that, as with the Scottish independence referendum:

“ . . . similarly competing and irreconcilable claims will be made by the opposing sides in the campaign around the anticipated referendum on the United Kingdom’s continuing membership of the European Union, following the coming general election. Those wishing the UK to break from the EU will doubtless extol the mythic virtues and heroic vigour of Albion unbound. Those advocating the UK’s continued membership of the EU – like those who campaigned for Scotland’s to stay in the (British) Union – will find it difficult to articulate a positive vision of Europe which will resonate with (particularly English) voters and will, instead, fall back on emphasising the economic dangers and market uncertainties which will come with our ‘turning our back on Europe” and falling prey to those vices (at least, etymologically) associated with island life: isolationism and insularity.”

3. Nobody likes a smart-arse, of course. And the cry “I told you so” is perhaps up there with “We’re doomed” as the two phrases most associated by so many south of the Border with the stereotypical picture of the gloomy self-righteous Caledonian. So I will refrain from their use now.

Asymmetric devolution: the invisible nation

4. Our island nation has become enveloped in a complexity of enriching political, economic, legal, ethical and cultural ties with our fellow European nations and peoples since the end of the Second World War. This great European peace has been fostered under the auspices of the European Union and the Council of Europe. The idea that that web of connexions should be rent asunder on the basis of sub-Trump sloganeering of “taking back control of immigration” to “make Britain Great again” is frankly depressing. Little Britain: big Europe.

5. The unacknowledged (or, perhaps, unrealized) problem, is that the reason the UK’s continued membership of the EU – or indeed its membership of the Council of Europe – has, after years of fringe grumbling, now assumed central stage (at least within the Tory party) is because of our asymmetric devolution. The anxiety that is really being expressed here is about the status of England – unrepresented in either the British union or the European Union. The invisible nation.

6. Owing to devolution within the UK and the new understanding it brings, I think we are beginning to appreciate that the United Kingdom is not a “nation state” but a “state of nations”. What has not been taken into account in that, is England. Everyone else seems able to define who they are by not being English. The problem is that the elements of the English are now defining themselves by not being European. That is a retrograde step. It is against that background of that anxiety that I understand the calls for a “British Bill of Rights”. It is instead an English Bill of Rights that it being sought, so that Magna Carta can take its place once more as the real fount of England’s imagined liberties, rather than the foreign “unEnglish” imposition that is the European Convention on Human Rights. I don’t have a problem with a new English Bill of Rights, as an assertion or recognition of England within the union, as long as the UK remains signed up to the ECHR because it keeps the (British and European) Unions together; it provide a uniform level of protection across the four nations of the British union, and keeps us integrated in that broader, post-Nuremburg European project that is the European Union.

7. The unexpected victory of the Tory party in the last general election could also be seen to be another expression of this anxiety about England and Englishness. The Conservative party election campaign expressly played into fears that the UK would be governed by Scottish Nationalists, propping up a minority Labour Government but at the price of holding the England to ransom for yet more powers, more money, more special treatment for Scotland within the union. Voting in a Conservative majority in May 2015 avoided that fate, but still left the problem of England unresolved. English votes for English laws is not enough. Instead, there is a semi- or sub-conscious desire for somewhere and somehow to express a respectable – i.e. not racist or semi-fascist – English nationalism. People want to show they are not ashamed of being English, that Englishness is not captured in images of drunken football fans rioting abroad. I fear, therefore, that what this EU referendum has become is a form of displacement activity, a chance for the English voters to affirm their Englishness. That is, perhaps, one way of explaining why the opinion polls show such a difference in voting intentions between Scotland and England on the issue of Brexit. Scottish voters seem to be comfortable with remaining in the EU – perhaps because Scotland remains a country which is more characterized by the emigration of its native-born, often taking the high road that leads to England (the “noblest prospect for a Scotchman” as (Samuel) Johnson had it) rather than by large scale influxes of other European free movers seeking work north of the border.

And for Scotland?

8. Thus we have the phenomenon of Scotland’s current First Minister, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon MSP, wholeheartedly campaigning for a Remain vote. While Scotland’s immediately past First Minister, the SNP’s Alex Salmond MP, asserts that a vote by an English majority for the UK to leave the EU against a Scottish vote for the UK to remain in the EU will constitute a mandate for another Scottish independence referendum to be held. This time, if the rest of the UK were allowed to vote in it, I suspect that we would find that the English would vote “yes” for Scottish independence, regardless of what the Scots want (a situation similar to break up of Czechoslovakia when ultimately the Czech Government insisted on Slovak independence, rather than allow for the still further devolution sought by Slovakia).

9. So I think Sir John Major is right: a vote in favour of Brexit will ultimately mean that England leaves not just the European Union but repudiates the British union.

10. In the event of England voting for Brexit and Scotland voting to stay in the EU, the question is whether the other EU Member States would accept Scotland (perhaps even in an enforced confederation with Northern Ireland, assuming a majority of its divided populace expressing a wish to remain within the EU) as a new or continuing EU Member State. The idea of Scotland (and Northern Ireland) being recognized for purposes of EU membership negotiation as the continuing UK (England and Wales having, on this analysis chosen to secede – as Greenland did from Denmark – to form a new entity outside the EU) is that the scenario involving (a significant) part of a Member State leaving the EU would not establish any precedent for regions seeking to secede from existing continuing Member States (for example, Catalonia and Spain) to have any right or expectation of entitlement to their own independent EU membership.

11. From a broader geo-political perspective one could see that Germany, for example, might well see some benefits in a divide and rule policy and encourage the breakup of the United Kingdom by offering a sweetheart deal for Scotland and Northern Ireland to remain in. It would mean that England and Wales would remain physically and psychologically encircled by the territory of the EU rather than open to the Atlantic. North Sea and Irish Sea oil and gas would remain assets within the EU and their benefits more readily exploited for common EU use given that an independent Scotland will have a much lower bargaining power in the EU than it had as part of the United Kingdom.

12. Doubtless the SNP would seek to ensure that independence was a “safe option”, with Scotland’s independence from the rest of the UK to come about only if Scotland’s continuing place within the European Union had been suitably secured and all the uncertainties (whether about keeping the pound or joining the Euro or joining the Schengen area or staying as part of any continuing British and Irish common travel area) had been resolved. On this scenario of Scotland’s independence from the British union being simultaneous with Scotland’s accession to independent membership of the European Union (and the rest of the UK’s withdrawal from Europe) the holding of the new status of Scottish citizenship would bring with it the benefits of being an EU citizen. For example, the siting of corporate headquarters in Edinburgh rather than London would be presented as allowing companies full access to the single European market which might be denied to those who choose to remain based now outside the EU in the rest of the UK.

13. The question for the SNP however is: would a post-Brexit/little Englander UK Prime Minister, such as Boris Johnson (no relation?), be willing to allow for such a “velvet divorce”? This scenario need never be faced up to if we all (or just a majority of us) vote to stay in, and therefore keep Britain in Europe. But, whatever the result, the question of how England is to be recognised and protected within Britain has to be properly and coherently addressed and answered."

The result of Brexit referendum has revealed certain difficult truths about our nation. England is an unhappy country. The vote shows that the English are politically riven in terms of class, educational level, age, and (non-)metropolitan status. It has revealed what was for so long obvious; that London is not in, or of, England. It is an international(ist) city- state whose politics and economy and outlook are wholly different from the nation whose capital it nominally is. And Scotland is another country; they do things differently there.

One thing is clear, however: the result of the referendum has to be respected and acted upon by all our politicians. That is what living in a democracy means. So let us end this talk of a second Brexit referendum, or these calls on our MPs to refuse to implement the will of the people on the Brechtian grounds (in his poem Die Lösung) that “the people has forfeited the confidence of the government”.

Brecht’s poem concludes “ would it not be easier in that case for the government to dissolve the people and elect another?”. But it seems to me that the result of the Brexit referendum has done exactly that. It has revealed that there is not one demos, one people, within the United Kingdom. There are instead peoples, demoi. The British people has been dissolved.

The referendum has revealed radically different visions about our European future and place in the world between Scotland (and Northern Ireland) on the one hand, and England and Wales (excluding London) on the other. Respecting democracy on this basis means respecting the decision of the people of England and Wales no longer to be citizens of a member State of the European Union. Equally, however, respect for democracy means honouring the expressed wish of the people of Scotland (and Northern Ireland) to remain as full participant citizens in the supranational polity that is the EU.

So rather than arguing over when and how Article 50 TEU might be activated and by whom, or whether the two year clock ticking for exit can be stopped once started, we need as responsible citizens in a democracy to face up in good faith to what many of us regard as an appalling result, and coalesce around pressing for the quickest possible conclusion of the least worst option which still respects the actual referendum result.

The Brexit referendum has given no mandate or guidance as to what our future relationship might be with Europe. The best and cleanest way to respect the referendum result (both in the fact that a majority voted to leave the EU but that a large minority voted for no change) would be to seek the minimum possible change compatible with the UK no longer being a Member State. This minimal change means, in my view, joining Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein in the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA Agreement was concluded in 1993 and looks remarkably like the Treaty of Rome prior to its amendment by the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which first brought Tory Euro-scepticism to the fore. Article 1 EEA states

The aim of this Agreement of association is to promote a continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relations between the Contracting Parties with equal conditions of competition, and the respect of the same rules, with a view to creating a homogeneous European Economic Area, hereinafter referred to as the EEA. In order to attain the objectives set out in paragraph 1, the association shall entail, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement :

(a) the free movement of goods; (b) the free movement of persons; (c) the free movement of services; (d) the free movement of capital; (e) the setting up of a system ensuring that competition is not distorted and that the rules thereon are equally respected; as well as (f) closer cooperation in other fields, such as research and development, the environment, education and social policy.

The case law of the Court of Justice on those provisions of the EU Treaties and secondary EU legislation which are “identical in substance to corresponding rules” of the EEA Agreement are binding, but only up until the date of the signature of the original EEA Agreement: Article 6 EEA. What this means is that the acquis communautaire of the Court of Justice prior to the development of EU citizenship rights binds, but that the CJEU has no general continuing jurisdiction in relation to the interpretation of the EEA Agreement.

The EEA States have their own institutions to police the EEA Agreement: instead of the Commission there is the EFTA Surveillance Authority; instead of the CJEU there is the EFTA Court; and there is no role for the European Parliament. There is provision for inter-governmental co-operation with the EU in the form of the EEA Council (which consists of the members of the EU Council and members of the European Commission, and of one member of the Government of each of the EEA States) and the EEA Joint Committee (which consist of representatives of the Contracting Parties and which take decisions by agreement between the EU, on the one hand, and the EEA States “speaking with one voice” on the other”).

England’s current difficulty is that it has no leader, a fundamentally divided populace and no mandate as to what any future relationship might be sought from the EU. Given that membership of the EEA guarantees free movement of workers and the self-employed it might be thought to go against the anti-migration sentiments which appeared to have fuelled much of the vote in favour Brexit south of the Border.

Scotland, however, has a First Minister who is undoubtedly in charge of her party, a population which was remarkably united in the referendum, and a clear mandate from the referendum to the effect that Scotland wants to stay in the EU.

In the next three months or so while the Tory party seeks a new leader and England goes into meltdown in trying to gauge what so ailed the country, Nicola Sturgeon has an opportunity now to forge strong positive links across Europe and among the big players within the EU institutions to push the idea that what has happened is not that the UK as a whole has voted to leave the EU but that England and Wales voted to secede from the Union (both British and European) leaving Scotland (possibly in confederation with Northern Ireland) as the faithful remnant ready and able to maintain their EU membership which needs only to be slightly re-jigged, but not fundamentally altered, to take account of England’s and Wales’ secessions.

Ultimately, if Scotland does persuade the rest of the EU round on this, and Nicola Sturgeon can negotiate a package in principle for Scotland (whether or not with Northern Ireland) being regarded as the continuing UK for EU law purposes, then she can present this package to the Scottish people to be voted on in the second Scottish Independence Referendum (the Scotland Act 1998 would have to be amended by Westminster to allow this to take place lawfully, rather than by UDI). If she wins that referendum, Scotland gets a soft transition involving ending the British Union but maintaining the European Union, while England is left to wrestle its nationalist demons unencumbered by its northern Celtic fringe of which it knew increasingly little and cared ever less.

Interestingly Article 121(a) EEA states that

The provisions of this Agreement shall not preclude cooperation : (a) within the framework of the Nordic cooperation to the extent that such cooperation does not impair the good functioning of this Agreement.

The Helsinki Treaty of 1962 states in its preamble that “the Governments of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, desir[e] to promote and strengthen the close ties existing between the Nordic peoples in matters of culture, and of legal and social philosophy, and to extend the scale of co-operation between the Nordic countries; [and] desir[e] to attain uniformity of regulation throughout the Nordic countries in as many respects as possible.” Its terms were most recently updated at 1995 and now contain the following provisions, among others, on Nordic co-operation:

ARTICLE 1 The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to maintain and develop further co-operation between the Nordic countries in the legal, cultural, social and economic fields, as well as in those of transport and communications and environmental protection. The High Contracting Parties should hold joint consultations on matters of common interest which are dealt with by European and other international organisations and conferences. Legal Co-operation ARTICLE 2 In the drafting of laws and regulations in any of the Nordic countries, citizens of all the other Nordic countries shall be treated equally with the citizens of the aforementioned country. This shall apply within all those areas falling within the jurisdiction of the Treaty of Co-operation. Exceptions to the first paragraph may, however, be made if a requirement of citizenship is constitutionally stipulated, or is necessary because of other international obligations or is otherwise deemed necessary for particular reasons. ARTICLE 3 The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to facilitate the acquisition by citizens of one Nordic country of citizenship in another Nordic country. ARTICLE 4 The High Contracting Parties shall continue their co-operation in the field of law with the aim of attaining the greatest possible uniformity in the field of private law. ARTICLE 5 The High Contracting Parties should seek to establish uniform rules relating to criminal offences and the penalties for such offences. With regard to criminal offences committed in one of the Nordic countries, it shall, as far as circumstances allow, be possible to investigate and prosecute the offence in another Nordic country. ARTICLE 6 The High Contracting Parties shall seek to achieve a co-ordination of legislation in such areas, other than the aforementioned, as are considered appropriate. ARTICLE 7 Each High Contracting Party should endeavour to ensure the implementation of regulations to allow decisions by a court of law or other public authority in another Nordic country to be executed also in the territory of the said Party.

If England and Wales were to join the EEA but Scotland (and possibly also Northern Ireland) were to remain within the EU, the Nordic co-operation agreement could also provide a useful template for a co-operation agreement to determine future relations between the now independent countries of the former British Isles (or the Anglo-Celtic Archipelago (ACA), as it might usefully henceforth be termed given the need for Ireland’s full participation within it). On this model, the analogue to Norway within the ACA is England and Wales; Northern Ireland may be seen to be a parallel Iceland; Scotland would map on to Sweden, and the Republic of Ireland to Finland.

This then becomes a positive story from an EU perspective, showing that the Brexit vote result was not because there are fundamental problems with the EU, but because there are fundamental problems with England which may be summed up as “England has a problem with London, and London a problem with England”. But the Brexit referendum results are respected, with England and Wales joining the EEA and Scotland and Northern Ireland staying within the EU.

Ultimately it could well be in England’s interest to have Scotland remain in the EU to argue by proxy its case and protect our common island interests from within the EU. The fundamental change in relationship between Scotland and England – which might also involve Scotland gaining a veto on any future free trade/investment treaties (“mixed agreements”) concluded between the EU and non-EU countries such as the prospective new independent state of England and Wales- might be good for us all.

Conrad Russell once observed that the fundamental problem with the Treaty of Union was that England would brook no equal and Scotland no superior. If Scotland stays in the EU then, like, Ireland it might begin to grow up and de-infantilise and lose its readiness to play the exploited victim. And England will at last, guilt-free, get to be England. The English will truly get their country back, whatever that might turn out to be.

On 20 December 2016, the Scottish Government released its blueprint on how Scotland can remain in the European Single Market post-Brexit. From the governing SNP’s point of view, the paper can be seen as a compromise given that it does not advocate Scottish independence. Instead, it proposes that the best outcome for the UK as a whole is to remain in the European Economic Agreement following the ‘Norway model’. It recognises, however, that in the current political constellation this seems unlikely. So, it argues for the continued membership of Scotland in the European Single Market.

This can happen through the EEA equivalent of the ‘Reverse Greenland’ model. The UK will maintain its EEA membership but there will be a territorial exemption for England and Wales. The EEA acquis will fully apply only in Scotland (and potentially in Northern Ireland). The precedent for that can be also found in the Arctic circle. Norway has secured a territorial exemption for the insular islands of the archipelago of Svalbard that are not part of EEA.

The Scottish Government recognises that the realization of the proposal will need flexibility both from the UK Government and the European partners. To this effect, the blueprint suggests certain ways in order to somehow absorb the tensions coming from a differentiated Brexit. In a recently published paper I have explained that the ‘Reverse Greenland’ model would lead to the creation of a hard customs border within the territory of the UK. This is why the Scottish Government suggests that Scotland should remain within the UK customs area.

With regard to the free movement of persons, however, the suggestions are less comprehensive. First, the proposal does not explain who of those residing in Scotland will be considered EEA nationals and thus enjoy the free movement principle and who will not. More importantly, and with regard to the management of the territorial border between an area where the free movement of persons will apply (Scotland) and one that will not (England and Wales) the proposal suggests a smart but unclear solution. It suggests that whatever instruments are used for the Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland border should be applied mutatis mutandis between Scotland and England. It is true that the UK Government has promised that the Irish border will not become a ‘hard border’. However, neither the UK Government nor the Northern Ireland Executive nor the Government of the Republic have explained how this aim will be achieved. So, drawing an analogy with a policy that has not yet been crystalised and at the moment it is far from clear what will exactly entail, is a high risk policy for the Scottish Government.

More importantly, the paper advocates a dramatic constitutional amendment to the devolution arrangement in order Scotland to take part effectively in the political and legal life of the European single market. According to the blueprint, Scotland would have to acquire competences in a number of areas, such as international relations like the Belgian sub-state entities and immigration like Quebec. In particular, the proposal challenges the very idea of ‘repatriation of powers’ by questioning which patria (home country) should acquire the competences that are currently exercised by the EU. Is it Westminster or Holyrood the appropriate forum for the formulation of the immigration policy in Scotland?

Given the dramatic changes that such an arrangement would mark to the constitutional status quo of the UK, one has to wonder why the UK government would accept such a solution. Equally, there is a question why Scotland would settle for something less than its independence. For the UK Government, the biggest incentive to sponsor Scotland’s Single Market membership would be that it represents a tangible alternative to secession. The UK might become almost a confederation but it will still be one recognised State under international law. On the other hand, Scotland could avoid the tensions that a second independence referendum might create.

In any case, both the current UK and European legal frameworks seem somehow unable to accommodate the very different aspirations of the UK constituent nations. In this sense, their significant amendment is almost unavoidable."

In his poem The Second Coming written in 1919 at a time of political and social ferment across Europe and an earlier constitutional breakdown within the United Kingdom, WB Yeats (that great Anglo-Irishman, a descendant and representative of “no petty people”) wrote the following lines:

… Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity. Surely some revelation is at hand ….

Against that apocalyptic vision, it is of some interest to note a recent op-ed piece in the Irish Times, in which the Irish writer Fintan O’Toole has made the intriguing suggestion that one possible political response to the further break-down of our constitutional order which the Brexit vote heralds, might be for a complete re-configuration of the nations within the Anglo Celtic Archipelago/Atlantic Isles. He suggests that Scotland and Northern Ireland might leave (and so dissolve) the United Kingdom, and join Ireland in some form of, a yet to be worked out, union.

Historic precedent for a Scots-Irish union ?

It is sometimes said to be a characteristic of the Scots and Irish that (like the Bourbons) that they have learned nothing and forgotten nothing. Their role in a Tolkien saga might be that of “The Grudge Bearers”.

In that spirit, and taking the approach of la longue durée to Fintan O’Toole’s suggestion, we might find some historic precedent for setting up a Scottish-Irish Union (sans et contre l’Angleterre) in the campaign of Edward Bruce, younger brother of and then heir to Robert Bruce, who in the year after his brother’s 1314 victory at Bannockburn, sailed to Ireland from Scotland with a sizeable fighting force and there allied with native Irish fighting against Anglo-Norman magnates owing fealty to the English crown, and had himself proclaimed High King of Ireland.

This is attested to in a remarkable document of 1317 which the native Irish princes (led by Donal O’Neill, king of Cenel Eoghain or Tyrone) addressed to the Avignon Pope John XXII through two of his papal nuncios who were then in England attempting to broker a post-Bannockburn peace between Edward II of England and Robert Bruce, King of Scots. This Remonstrance notes in part as follows:

“[O]n account of the injustice of the kings of England and their wicked ministers and the constant treachery of the English of mixed race, who, by the ordinance of the Roman curia, were bound to rule our nation with justice and moderation and have set themselves wickedly to destroy it; and in order to shake off the hard and intolerable yoke of their slavery and to recover our native liberty, which for a time through them we lost, we are compelled to wage deadly war with them, aforesaid, preferring under stress of necessity to put ourselves like men to the trial of war in defence of our right, rather than to bear like women their atrocious outrages. And that we may be able to attain our purpose more speedily and fitly in this respect, we call to our help and assistance Edward Bruce, illustrious earl of Carrick, brother of Robert by the grace of God most illustrious king of the Scots, who is sprung from our noblest ancestors. And as it is free to anyone to renounce his right and transfer it to another, all the right which is publicly known to pertain to us in the said kingdom as its true heirs, we have given and granted to him by our letters patent, and in order that he may do therein judgment and justice and equity which through default of the prince Edward II the King of England have utterly failed therein, we have unanimously established and set Edward Bruce up as our king and lord in our kingdom aforesaid, for in our judgment and the common judgment of men he is pious and prudent, humble and chaste, exceedingly temperate, in all things sedate and moderate, and possessing power (God on high be praised) to snatch us mightily from the house of bondage with the help of God and our own justice, and very willing to render to everyone what is due to him of right, and above all is ready to restore entirely to the Church in Ireland the possessions and liberties of which she was damnably despoiled, and he intends to grant greater liberties than ever otherwise she has been wont to have. May it please you therefore, most Holy Father, for the sake of justice and general peace mercifully to approve what we have done as regards our said lord and king Edward Bruce, forbidding the King of England and our aforesaid adversaries henceforward to molest us, or at least be pleased to render us with fitting favour our due complement of justice in respect of them. For know, our revered Father, that besides the kings of lesser Scotia who all drew the source of their blood from our greater Scotia, retaining to some extent our language and habits, a hundred and ninety seven kings of our blood have reigned over the whole island of Ireland.

The Avignon Papacy neither recognised Edward Bruce’s claim to the High Kingship of Ireland, nor did it respond favourably to the Irish princes’ Remonstrance. In October 1318 the Scots-Irish army under Edward Bruce was defeated by the Anglo-Norman forces of Edward II. Edward Bruce was killed, his body quartered and sent throughout Ireland and his head delivered to King Edward II.

The Scottish parallel document to the Irish Princes’ Remonstrance is the Declaration of Arbroath of 1320. Like the Irish Remonstrance this was again, in form, a letter to Pope, John XXII in his capacity as an international arbiter, requesting him to “admonish and exhort the King of the English” to end his grumbling on-going military campaign in Scotland and “to leave us Scots in peace”. The complaint was made that in invading Scotland – which earlier Popes had recognized as constituting a distinct kingdom and people with its own church hierarchy independent from that of England – and seeking to subdue and/or annex Scotland to his kingdom, the English king Edward I (“Hammer of the Scots”) and his son Edward II had carried out wanton acts of “cruelty, massacre, violence, pillage, arson, imprisoning prelates, burning down monasteries, robbing and killing monks and nuns, and yet other outrages without number which he committed against our people, sparing neither age nor sex, religion nor rank”. The letter was composed by a Scottish Churchman, Bernard de Linton, the Abbot of Arbroath, and was signed by leading nobles and gentry bearing to represent “the whole community of the realm of Scotland”. Two other letters in similar terms – from the Scottish clergy and from the King of Scots – were composed at the same time but no copies of these have survived. The surviving letter suggested that any failure on the part of Pope John XXII to condemn the English action in Scotland would tarnish such reputation he might hope to garner for himself as a defender of the Church, of Christendom and of the Christian Holy places. The letter claimed that Papal interests were directly concerned in this issue on the basis that the continued war of the English against the Scots was preventing the Scots from participating in a Crusade in the Holy Land. It stated, too, that the English campaign against the Scots was being used by the English simply as an excuse not to join in the Crusade, suggesting that “the real reason that prevents them is that in making war on their smaller neighbours they find quicker profit and weaker resistance”. The letter advised the Pope that he would be to blame for “the slaughter of bodies, the perdition of souls, and all the other misfortunes that will follow, inflicted by them on us and by us on them” if he should favour the English claims in this dispute.

Crucially, like the Remonstrance, the Declaration of Arbroath makes important constitutional claims about kingship. First it says that “it was the due consent and assent of us all have made Robert Bruce our Prince and King”. Secondly, it affirms that the continued kingship of Robert Bruce was conditional on his maintaining the integrity and independence of the Scottish nation, for

“[I]f he should give up what he has begun, and agree to make us or our kingdom subject to the King of England or the English, we should exert ourselves at once to drive him out as our enemy and a subverter of his own rights and ours, and make some other man who was well able to defend us our King. For, as long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule. It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom — for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.”

Pope John XXII’s initial response to the Scottish document was to support the Scottish claims and a peace treaty was concluded between Scotland and England in 1323. It may be that this was simply the Papacy doing nothing more than recognizing the political and military realities on the ground, rather than acting in any sense as an independent supra-national arbitrator and peace-broker.

The most interesting aspect of both the Irish Princes’ Remonstrance of 1317 and the Scottish magnates’ Declaration of Arbroath of 1320 (apart from the fact that Mel Gibson cribbed the latter document for the screenplay of Braveheart) is how they both claim that the legitimacy of the ruler rests on the consent of the people.

This is an idea which is more fully developed in a work of 1324 CE, Defensor Pacis (“Defender of the Peace”), by Marsilius of Padua who relied on Aristotle’s Politics to reclaim a view which saw political power and authority as being conferred from the bottom up, by and from the people. Among the conclusions reached by Marsilius were that:

“the whole body of citizens or its majority alone is the human ‘legislator’”;

“the ‘legislator’ alone or the one who rules by its authority has the power to dispense with human laws”;

“the elective principality or other office derives its authority from the election of the body having the right to elect, and not from the confirmation or approval of any other power”;

“there can be only one supreme ruling power in a State or kingdom”; and that

“no prince, still more, no partial council or single person of any position, has full authority and control over other persons, laymen or clergy, without the authorization of the ‘legislator’.

In reaching these conclusions, among other, Marsilius ran wholly counter to the prevailing theologically driven “top-down” debates which focused instead on the supposed details of the authority and power which had been granted by God to ecclesiastical and secular rulers, upon which Edward II rested his claims to be entitled to rule over Scotland and Ireland as well as England.

In so re-positioning the debate about sovereignty away from God and on to the people, Marsilius anticipated and became, in a sense, the father of modern democratic political thought. The focus which Marsilius put on the sovereignty of the people would prove in time to be just as potentially revolutionary for kings as it was for Popes. Since if the political claims of the Popes could be questioned in the name of the people, so too, in time, might the claims of their secular rulers come to be challenged on the same basis.

Back to the Future

A post Brexit union of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland would certainly be one way of achieving what the majority of the electors of Northern Ireland and Scotland who voted in the Brexit referendum sought to achieve, namely to remain within the EU and retain their EU citizenship.

The dissolution of the United Kingdom consequent upon Scotland and Northern Ireland leaving would allow England and Wales would be free to continue its negotiations for their EU free future.

The conundrum of Northern Ireland would be resolved by the fact that the nationalists’ goal of a united island of Ireland would be achieved while the unionists’ community’s fear of being swamped by a Catholic majority could be allayed by union with a still predominantly Presbyterian Scotland.

Ireland’s population of 4.5 million currently makes it one of the smaller nations within the EU, with a consequent relative lack of voting power within the Council. The addition of Northern Ireland’s 1.8 million strong population, together with the 5.3 million resident in Scotland would provide an aggregate population in the newly expanded state of 11.6 million which would raise it to one of the medium sized nations of the EU. More people means more votes means more influence within the councils and institutions of the EU.

The 1990 merger between the German Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic provides a useful precedent from the point of view of EU law for an existing EU member State significantly increasing its territory and population while retaining all of its rights as a continuing member State without any form of European Treaty revision.

The suggested union between Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland would be far less radical, from an EU perspective, than the German case precisely because, unlike the citizens of the German Democratic Republic, the British citizens of Northern Ireland and Scotland are already EU citizens. And again, unlike the situation which prevailed in the German Democratic Republic immediately prior to its merger with the German Federal Republic, the economy, politics and legal systems of Northern Ireland and of Scotland are already integrated within the European Union.

The amendments to the Treaties consequent upon any union between Scotland and Northern Ireland would be minimal. In effect they would be limited to revising the definition and weighting of qualified majority voting in the Council and the European to reflect the increased relative population of the expanded member State and increasing number of representatives in the European Parliament reflect the relative expansion of the Member State formerly known as Ireland, both in terms of its population and territory.

A new name for a transformed State

What, then, to call this newly expanded member state ? The acronym for Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland is INIS which is the Gaelic for Island, as we are reminded (again by WB Yeats) in his poem The Lake Isle of Innisfree where, he tells us, we “shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow”."

During the weekend, there have been reports suggesting that Nicola Sturgeon will be soon calling a second Scottish independence referendum.

Such idea was developed in the December White Paper which advocated that Scotland could remain in the EU Single Market without seceding from the UK.

He did so, notwithstanding the fact that a special deal for Northern Ireland is the declared goal of the UK government. Clearly, such political developments mark a change in the strategy of those political leaderships. They now seem to tacitly suggest that it is more possible for those devolved nations to achieve their goal of remaining in the EU single market by seceding from the UK.

But why does the noble idea of a differentiated Brexit, that could absorb some of the tensions created by UK’s future withdrawal from the EU, seem to lose traction even within the political elites of Scotland and Northern Ireland? One possible answer to this question might be that the UK political and constitutional framework does not provide for a supportive environment. In fact, the judgment of the Supreme Court in Miller points to the limits of the UK political and constitutional order to accommodate the demands of the devolved nations.

In that case, the Court considered inter alia whether the UK Parliament is under an obligation to seek the consent of the devolved legislatures and especially the Scottish Parliament before passing the relevant legislation to leave the European Union. In particular, it was asked whether section 2 of Scotland Act 2016 which has codified the Sewel convention meant that the Westminster was constitutionally obliged to ask for the consent of the Scottish Parliament in order to trigger Article 50 TEU.

The eleven judges of the UK Supreme Court unanimously decided that the statutory footing of the convention does not change its legal nature. According to the Court, the UK Parliament was ‘not seeking to convert the Sewel Convention into a rule which can be interpreted, let alone enforced, by the courts’ [148]. It is still a political convention. That conclusion ‘follows from the nature of the content, and is acknowledged by the words (“it is recognised” and “will not normally”), of the relevant subsection’ [148].

The deference that the judges have showed is very much in accordance with the traditional role of judiciary in a constitutional order whose foundational principle is parliamentary sovereignty. If the Court had decided differently, it would have signalled a seismic change in the UK constitutional politics. The Court would have recognised that the federalisation process that the British constitutional order has undergone during the last decades can be understood as a ‘significant crack in what has traditionally been a monolithic acceptance […] of Westminster’s untrammelled legislative power’ as Tierney has pointed out.

Notwithstanding, I would still argue that – politically speaking at least – this approach might unintentionally trigger even more radical constitutional developments.

Bell and Lerner have examined different methods of successful constitution making in societies where the different ethno-religious segments have contrasting aspirations as to their political and constitutional future. At the moment, the UK is such a society to the extent that two out of the four constituent nations envisage their political and constitutional future as part of the single market. To this effect, the Scottish Government has advocated the idea of a differentiated Brexit, an idea that is also discussed with regard to Northern Ireland. If the Court had accepted the justiciability of the Sewel Convention, it would have provided for a very important lever to the devolved nations to achieve their goal. The Scottish and Northern Irish legislatures could have offered their consent to trigger Article 50 on the condition that the UK government would accept their demand for a differentiated Brexit.

By unanimously rejecting their argument, the Court (unintentionally) restricted the sub-constitutional space of Scotland and Northern Ireland to achieve their political aspiration of remaining in the single market. In fact, the decision has cast serious doubt on whether the devolved nations can achieve their goal of a differentiated Brexit within the current constitutional framework. Such doubt is rather strengthened by the fact that the system of UK intergovernmental relations does not seem to allow the two nations to influence the UK negotiating position in a meaningful way. So, the judicial decision might be used by political actors as supporting evidence to their argument that only an independent Scotland and a reunified Ireland may remain in the EU single market.

To a certain extent, the political consequences of this decision might bear certain similarities to the ones triggered by the 2010 decision of the Spanish Constitutional Tribunal on the Catalan Statute of Autonomy. In that case, the Spanish judges stroke down a number of articles of the Catalan Statute as unconstitutional. They did so, despite the fact that the Estatut had been approved by the Spanish Parliament and by the Catalan people in a referendum. Although, the Spanish Court did not show the deference to the political branch that their UK counterparts have showed, the political ramifications of the judgment and the strategical choices of the Spanish political elites have cast serious doubt on whether the Catalans could achieve their aspiration of greater political and constitutional autonomy within the current constitutional framework. Following that decision, the Catalan movement for independence has grown to such an extent that President Puigdemont has vowed to hold a referendum on independence in 2017.

The recent statements of Nicola Sturgeon and Enda Kenny might be pointing to a similar direction…"

Theresa May’s announcement of a Great Repeal Bill at Tory party conference on Sunday has the hallmarks of a stroke of genius: It creates some momentum in the internal Brexit debate without substantively changing anything and without thereby compromising her negotiating position with the EU. It appeases the die-heart Brexiteers in her party by seemingly following their Brexit-blueprint released last week. It may kill off legal challenges pending in the courts of England and Northern Ireland demanding that Parliament be involved before Article 50 TEU is triggered. It may buy her valuable time before starting the formal withdrawal process as the Great Repeal Bill is likely to get bogged down in parliamentary proceedings – let’s not forget that absent a manifesto promise to the repeal the European Communities Act 1972 the House of Lords is not bound by the Salisbury Convention and is free to delay such a move. Lastly, it evokes positive memories of the Great Reform Act of 1832, which considerably broadened and equalised the franchise (for men only, of course) and set Britain on its way to become a modern democracy. Those who want to ‘take back control’ will be pleased.

The proposal of a Great Repeal Bill is rather simple: a Bill will be announced in the next Queen’s speech that the European Communities Act 1972 (ECA) will be repealed. This repeal however will only take effect on the date that the UK has left the EU in accordance with the process foreseen in the EU Treaties – the famous Article 50 TEU. Intriguingly, the Great Repeal Bill will also provide for all EU law currently in force in the UK to be enshrined in UK law and therefore to remain in force. This is a most sensible step as it is the practically only way of avoiding huge gaps, which a wholesale repeal of the ECA would leave. At present the validity of most EU law within the UK legal order depends upon it: directly applicable and directly effective rules such as the Treaty rights and EU Regulations are only applicable because section 2 (1) ECA so decrees. In addition, EU Directives are usually transposed by way of secondary legislation – by so-called Order in Council – under section 2 (2) ECA. Hence if the ECA were repealed without further ado, this would include repeal of this enabling provision and would leave the secondary legislation concerned without a ‘hook’ in primary legislation: it too would cease to exist (for a longer discussion see here). It will be a long and arduous task for the civil service and parliament to sift through each and every piece of legislation and decide whether it is worth keeping or not. If this exercise were to be carried out before Brexit, most people who voted in the referendum would probably not live to see the day.

One option of enshrining EU law in existence into UK law would be to stipulate that ‘all EU law in force on the date of withdrawal from the EU remains in force’. While this ‘grandfathering’ may not prove to be a practical solution where mutual obligations such as free movement provisions are concerned, it may well prove to be sensible with regard to many technical provisions on product rules, the environment, labour and consumer law, etc. So far, so clever.

The Great Reform Bill however raises interesting constitutional questions with regard to the devolved nations of the UK, and in particular Scotland. The devolution settlement is based on the premise that the Westminster Parliament remains sovereign, i.e. according to Dicey ‘it can make or unmake any law whatever.’ Yet where it legislates on devolved matters, the so-called Sewel Convention says that ‘will not normally legislate […] without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.’ Comparable conventions leading to what is called a ‘legislative consent motion’ exist also with regard to the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies. The problem with the attempt at enshrining all EU law into UK law as envisaged by the Great Repeal Bill is that a significant proportion of that EU law relates to matters that are currently devolved: for instance, environmental law, agriculture, fishing within the Scottish zone – just to mention a few. Were the Great Repeal Bill to adopt a wholesale approach to all EU law currently in place in the UK, it would have to be considered to be legislating with regard to devolved matters. Under Sewel, the consent of the Scottish Parliament would need to be sought and so would the consent of the two Assemblies. Given the fact that 62% of Scots voted to remain in the EU and that the Scottish government is opposed to ‘Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will’, this consent is not readily forthcoming. So has Theresa May scored an own goal by allowing the Scots to block her first big step towards Brexit? Or is this part of an even more cunning plan to delay having to trigger Article 50 TEU for a very long time?

Having said that, the Sewel Convention is ‘only’ a convention although it has recently been enshrined in the Scotland Act 2016. This does not detract from the fact that it is merely politically binding and not enforceable in the courts; nor does it resolve the question whether a repeal of the ECA is ‘normal’. Politically speaking these are side issues. What counts is how Scottish and Westminster politicians will react: if Westminster decides to ignore the need for a legislative consent motion, can Scottish nationalists portray it as yet another Westminster betrayal in their pitch for another independence referendum? Or can Westminster reassure the Scots that the Great Repeal Bill is really something that will keep as much EU law as possible within the Scottish legal order and thereby account for the wishes of the Scottish electorate? Let’s wait and see. We live in interesting times."

Article 50(1) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) provides that

“Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.”

It was therefore a requirement of EU law that the United Kingdom identify just what the “United Kingdom constitution” requires to constitute a decision to leave the EU. The United Kingdom government’s position was that it could simply rely upon the foreign affairs prerogative to make such a decision and unilaterally begin the process for the secession of the United Kingdom from the EU. The Supreme Court, by an 8-3 majority, disagreed. In a single, though apparently multi-authored, opinion the majority (Lord Neuberger, Lady Hale, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr, Lord Clarke, Lord Wilson, Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge) ruled (at para 122):

“The essential point is that, if, as we consider, what would otherwise be a prerogative act would result in a change in domestic law, the act can only lawfully be carried out with the sanction of primary legislation enacted by the Queen in Parliament.”

In three individually authored separate opinions Lords Reed, Carnwath and Hughes set out their reasons for dissenting from this conclusion. All three dissenters expressly agreed with the majority’s approach on the devolution issues in the case, and added no independent analysis to this. The Supreme Court was, therefore, unanimous in its treatment of the devolution arguments which had been aired before it, finding in favour of the United Kingdom Government’s analysis (which was supported by the Attorney General for Northern Ireland) and rejecting the positions taken by the Scottish and Welsh Governments, who had not taken an active part in the proceedings before the (English) Divisional Court, but who were permitted to intervene on the appeal from the Divisional Court to the Supreme Court. The court held that nothing in the United Kingdom’s constitution imposed any legally enforceable requirement that the devolved legislatures or governments be consulted or involved in the process of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, and that no agreement was not required from them prior to, or as a condition of, the passing of any relevant withdrawal legislation by the United Kingdom Parliament.

This was a difficult and highly politically sensitive case for the court. But despite – or perhaps because of – their unanimity on the devolution issues, the Supreme Court’s treatment of these matters is somewhat troubling. The devolution aspects of the United Kingdom constitution appear to have been regarded by the court almost as an unnecessary distraction from the main event. Two cases from Northern Ireland (McCord and Agnew and others) were heard with the Miller appeal. But counsel for the claimants in these Northern Ireland cases were permitted only 30 minutes to share between them for their oral submissions in the four days which the Supreme Court had otherwise set aside to hear oral argument from all the litigants, interested parties and interveners who had participated in the English Divisional Court proceedings. The result is that none of the judgments from the court – whether of the majority or in dissent – appeared to rise to the challenge of arguments for pluralism as essential for the proper understanding of the constitutional law of the United Kingdom, understood as a State of Nations with quite separate constitutional histories and as a Union which maintains distinct constitutional traditions. Instead, at paragraph 41, the majority judgment simply refers to “seminal events” in the history of the relationship among “the three principal organs of the state, the legislature (the two Houses of Parliament), the executive (ministers and the government more generally) and the judiciary (the judges)” and notes that

“a series of statutes enacted in the twenty years between 1688 and 1707 were of particular legal importance. Those statutes were the Bill of Rights 1688/9 and the Act of Settlement 1701 in England and Wales, the Claim of Right 1689 in Scotland, and the Acts of Union 1706 and 1707 in England and Wales and in Scotland respectively. (Northern Ireland joined the United Kingdom pursuant to the Acts of Union 1800 in Britain and Ireland). … Parliamentary sovereignty is a fundamental principle of the UK constitution, as was conclusively established in the statutes referred to.”

It cannot be correct to say that “Parliamentary sovereignty” was established in these statutes, as if pre-Union Scottish and English Parliaments could simply bootstrap themselves (or their successor, the post 1707 United Kingdom Parliament) into sovereignty. The Bill of Rights 1688/9 and the Scottish Claim of Right 1689 are certainly predicated on the primacy of the pre-Union English Parliament and the pre-Union Scottish Parliament over the English and Scottish Crowns respectively; but these two enactments are premised, if anything, on claims of popular sovereignty in their claims to justify the deposition of the monarch. In any event, the Supreme Court presumes what, at the very least, should have been argued for – namely that the 1707 Union was no revolutionary or foundational moment but that, instead, there was and is a constitutional continuity between pre-Union institutions of government in England and those of the United Kingdom after the Union. It assumes either that the Scottish Crown and the Scottish Parliament prior to 1707 had the same attributes and stood in the same relationship to one another as did the English Crown and English Parliament (which is historically debatable), or that such differences from the English position as existed in Scotland were erased by the 1707 Union. On this latter view in 1707 Scotland was, from a constitutional perspective (like Wales had been before it), simply subsumed into the realm and constitutional traditions of England. There is some support for this view: in Macgregor v Lord Advocate, 1921 SC 847 the Lord Ordinary (Lord Anderson) observed (at p 848) that “the constitution of Scotland has been the same as that of England since 1707 [and] there is a presumption that the same constitutional principles apply in both countries.” But there is authority to the opposite effect: in MacCormick v. Lord Advocate, 1953 SC 39, for example, Lord President Cooper stated that “the principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law.” As a constitutional court for the United Kingdom tasked with ascertaining the constitutional law of the United Kingdom, the Supreme Court should have at least adverted to these other constitutional traditions within the polity and, for example, explained if and how Lord Steyn was wrong when in Jackson v. Attorney General [2006] 1 AC 262 at para 102 he referred to the “settlement contained in the Scotland Act 1998” as pointing to a “divided sovereignty” in these islands and observed that

“The classic account given by Dicey of the doctrine of the supremacy of Parliament, pure and absolute as it was, can now be seen to be out of place in the modern United Kingdom. Nevertheless, the supremacy of Parliament is still the general principle of our constitution. It is a construct of the common law. The judges created this principle. If that is so, it is not unthinkable that circumstances could arise where the courts may have to qualify a principle established on a different hypothesis of constitutionalism.”

And just how was Lord Hope in error when he stated in the same case at paras 104, 126 that

“Our [United Kingdom] constitution is dominated by the sovereignty of Parliament. But Parliamentary sovereignty is no longer, if it ever was, absolute. It is not uncontrolled in the sense referred to by Lord Birkenhead LC in McCawley v The King [1920] AC 691, 720. It is no longer right to say that its freedom to legislate admits of no qualification whatever. Step by step, gradually but surely, the English principle of the absolute legislative sovereignty of Parliament which Dicey derived from Coke and Blackstone is being qualified. … [T]he concept of a Parliament that is absolutely sovereign is not entirely in accord with the reality. … The principle of parliamentary sovereignty which in the absence of higher authority, has been created by the common law is built upon the assumption that Parliament represents the people whom it exists to serve.”

If the treatment of the competing lines of Scottish referenced authority and tradition is under-developed, the Supreme Court’s approach to the constitutional history of Northern Ireland would also have benefitted from a deeper analysis. No acknowledgment is made of the divided and divisive legacy of the Glorious Revolution in Ireland: celebrated, on the one hand, by Loyalist marchers proclaiming it a victory for Protestant liberties; bitterly regretted by others as marking an end to James II and VII experiment in political toleration and equality of treatment for his Catholic subjects. And “Northern Ireland” did not join the United Kingdom pursuant to the Acts of Union 1800, as Supreme Court would have it. Instead, the United Kingdom of Britain and Ireland was created by the Acts of Union 1800 which were passed by the Westminster and Dublin Parliaments. The Proclamation of the Irish Republic which was read out from the steps of the Dublin General Post Office on Easter Monday 1916 sought to repudiate this Union in the name of (Irish) popular sovereignty, declaring “the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible”. On 6 December 1921, following over five years of civil unrest and military conflict in Ireland, there were signed in London by representatives of Great Britain on the one hand and of Ireland on the other (though when and how Great Britain and Ireland had again become distinct entities in international law is not clear) “Articles of an Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland”. The Westminster (Imperial) Parliament then enacted the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 and the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922, giving this British-Irish Treaty, and the Irish Free State Constitution, the force of domestic law: see Moore v. Attorney General for the Irish Free State [1935] AC 484, JCPC. Clause 11 of the British-Irish Treaty gave the Parliament of Northern Ireland (which had been brought into being as a devolved legislature by the Government of Ireland Act 1920) one month from the date of these Acts coming into force to decide whether the territory of Northern Ireland (“as determined in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, so far as may be compatible with economic and geographic conditions”) should remain in, or opt out from, the Irish Free State. Stormont duly exercised this opt out. So it was this decision, by a devolved Parliament sitting in Belfast, which created the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This newly formed United Kingdom’s relationship with the rest of Ireland remains as set out in the Ireland Act 1949 which, in Section 1(1) “recognized and declared that the part of Ireland heretofore known as Eire ceased, as from 18 April 1949, to be part of His Majesty’s dominions” but declared in Section 2(1) that “notwithstanding that the Republic of Ireland is not part of His Majesty’s dominions, the Republic of Ireland is not a foreign country for the purposes of any law in force in any part of the United Kingdom”.

And even within the English constitutional tradition, Blackstone speaks of “civil liberty” and of popular rather than Parliamentary sovereignty as foundations of the “British constitution” when discussing the constitutional limitations the constitution places on the prerogative powers of the “king of England” (sic). He notes at the outset of Chapter 7 “Of the King’s Prerogative” in Book 1 of his 1765-1769 Commentaries on the Laws of England that:

“one of the principal bulwarks of civil liberty, or (in other words) of the British constitution, was the limitation of the king’s prerogative by bounds so certain and notorious, that it is impossible he should ever exceed them, without the consent of the people, on the one hand; or without, on the other, a violation of that original contract, which in all states impliedly, and in ours most expressly, subsists between the prince and the subject.”

More recently yet, in Moohan v. Lord Advocate [2014] UKSC 67 [2015] 1 AC 901 Lord Hodge (in a majority judgment with which Lord Neuberger, Baroness Hale , Lord Clarke and Lord Reed agreed) stated at §35:

“I do not exclude the possibility that in the very unlikely event that a parliamentary majority abusively sought to entrench its power by a curtailment of the franchise or similar device, the common law, informed by principles of democracy and the rule of law and international norms, would be able to declare such legislation unlawful.”

None of this complex multi-national constitutional history – and the implications it might have for the theory and practice of sovereignty in the United Kingdom, whether Parliamentary or popular – appears to have been considered by the Supreme Court in Miller. Instead the Supreme Court’s reasoning proceeds on the assumption that the 19th century English constitutional tradition as formulated/invented by Dicey – the mythistory of England, as it may be termed – is the fount and only origin of the contemporary United Kingdom constitution. From the terms of the Supreme Court judgment, while the United Kingdom constitution may contain presumptions (for example, that specific rather than general statutory words are needed for the United Kingdom Parliament to override fundamental rights: para 87) it contains only two definite rules, namely that:

the United Kingdom Parliament has “the right to make or unmake any law whatsoever; and further, no person or body is recognised by the law as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament; and, further, that no person or body is recognised by the law of England (sic) as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament”: para 43, quoting and approving Dicey Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution (8th ed, 1915), page 38; and

(sic) as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament”: para 43, quoting and approving Dicey (8th ed, 1915), page 38; and “Proceedings in [the pre-1707 Union English] Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parliament” (para 145, citing Article 9 of the English Bill of Rights 1688/89.

On this reading of the principle of the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament, the Supreme Court’s dismissal of the arguments raised by the Northern Ireland claimants and by the Scottish and Welsh Governments about the need to involve the peoples, legislatures and governments of all parts of the Union in any decision for the UK to leave the EU, is inevitable yet unsatisfying. The judgement states (at para 129) that

“When enacting the EU constraints in the NI Act and the other devolution Acts, [the Westminster] Parliament proceeded on the assumption that the United Kingdom would be a member of the European Union. That assumption is consistent with the view that [the Westminster] Parliament would determine whether the United Kingdom would remain a member of the European Union.”

Yet, surely, it is equally consistent with the view that the Parliaments of the United Kingdom should properly be involved in the decision whether the United Kingdom would remain a member of the European Union ? The majority judgement continues (at paras 129-30):

“Within the United Kingdom, relations with the European Union, like other matters of foreign affairs, are reserved or excepted in the cases of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and are not devolved in the case of Wales …. Accordingly, the devolved legislatures do not have a parallel legislative competence in relation to withdrawal from the European Union.”

But no-one was arguing that the devolved legislatures had competence to pass their own legislation in the sphere of international relations or foreign affairs. The issue was whether the devolved legislatures (whose electorates, unlike that of the United Kingdom Parliament, encompass EU citizens from other Member States settled here) together with the United Kingdom Parliament had the right, as a matter of United Kingdom constitutional law and principle, to be involved in the decision that, and the basis upon which, the United Kingdom leave the European Union. And while the Supreme Court accepts (at para 130) that “the removal of the EU constraints on withdrawal from the EU Treaties will alter the competence of the devolved institutions unless new legislative constraints are introduced”, it then dismisses, as inconsistent with its vision and version of the untrammelled sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament, the Scottish and Welsh Governments’ arguments that the statutory requirement for the United Kingdom Parliament to seek the consent of the devolved legislatures when legislating with regard to devolved matters could ever be legally enforceable, let alone enforceable with regard to any legislation concerning the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.

The paradox of such a doctrine of untrammelled sovereignty is that it means that the otherwise unlimited Westminster Parliament has no Kompetenz-Kompetenz – it cannot bind its successors. How then does the Supreme Court account for those Westminster enactments which appear to do just that ? Examples of statutory provisions which look, on their face, to be creating new constitutional rules which future United Kingdom Parliaments are legally obliged to respect within the context of a devolved United Kingdom include:

Section 63A(1) of the Scotland Act 1998 (SA) which states that

“The Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government are a permanent part of the United Kingdom’s constitutional arrangements”.

Section 63A(3) SA which states that

“it is declared that the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government are not to be abolished except on the basis of a decision of the people of Scotland voting in a referendum.”

Section 1(1) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (NIA) which provides

“It is hereby declared that Northern Ireland in its entirety remains part of the United Kingdom and shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll

Section 28(8) SA which provides that

“But it is recognised that the Parliament of the United Kingdom will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.”

The Wales Bill 2016-2017 (which, at the time of writing, was still under consideration by the United Kingdom Parliament) contains, in Clauses 1 and 2, substantially identical provisions to Sections 28(8) SA and 63A SA. These clauses speak of the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government “as a permanent part of the United Kingdom’s constitutional arrangements …. not to be abolished except on the basis of a decision of the people of Wales voting in a referendum” and also confirm that that “the Parliament of the United Kingdom will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the [Welsh] Assembly”.

These references to the permanence of the devolved institutions and to the United Kingdom Parliament being unable to abolish them without the consent of the relevant demos – whether “the people of Scotland “, “a majority of the people of Northern Ireland” or “the people of Wales” – expressed through a referendum, rather looks like a recognition within the United Kingdom constitution of popular sovereignty, at least within the Celtic fringe. Yet in oral submissions before the Supreme Court the Advocate-General for Scotland (who presented argument on all the devolution aspects in Miller, McCord and Agnew on behalf of the United Kingdom government) dismissed these statutory provisions as no more than “self-denying ordinances” which did not token any binding of future United Kingdom Parliaments. On the Supreme Court’s analysis, however, they are not even that. Relying on past case law concerning constitutional conventions which had not been expressed in statutory form the court states (at 144) that “It is well established that the courts of law cannot enforce a political convention” and declares (at 146) that “judges therefore are neither the parents nor the guardians of political conventions; they are merely observers.” And it makes no difference to this court that, in the devolution context, conventions have been written into statute. This is said in the judgment (at para 144) to constitute no more than “legislative [i.e. not legal] recognition” of a “political convention” which “operates as a political restriction on the activity of the UK Parliament”. At para 149 the Supreme Court says that “the purpose of the legislative recognition of the convention was to entrench it as a convention.” This makes no sense however. There can be no “entrenchment” of any form, whether as law or convention, if the only constitutional rule which the Supreme Court is prepared to recognise is that the United Kingdom Parliament cannot bind its successors.

So we have another paradox that when the United Kingdom Parliament appears (by the plain and unequivocal language in the devolution statutes) to create constitutional rules which will bind future Westminster Parliaments, the Supreme Court denies it. In defence of its constitutional vision of the untrammelled sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament, the Supreme Court claims a right effectively to override, or set at naught, such legislation of the United Kingdom Parliament by “reading down” its clear legal provisions so that they are said, by the court, to be no more than expressions of legally unenforceable political aspirations. Having downgraded these statutory provisions to the status of “not law”, the court then concludes (at para 151) that the policing of its scope and the manner of operation of political conventions, even those expressed in statute, “does not lie within the constitutional remit of the judiciary, which is to protect the rule of law.” On the Supreme Court’s analysis the United Kingdom’s constitution exists in a perpetual present. It has no past, and no future. Ultimately the United Kingdom constitution can, for the Supreme Court, be nothing more than a description of whatever United Kingdom Parliament does, or allows for, on any particular day.

Miller was essentially a case which was argued before, and decided by, the court on the basis of the English Imperial constitutional tradition forged in the Victorian age. In retrospect it might have been better for the Scottish and Welsh Governments not to have intervened in the Miller appeal, and for the McCord and Agnew reference not to have been heard with Miller. This would have allowed the Miller case to have been decided (as it had been before the (English) Divisional Court) on the proper basis of solely English constitutional tradition and history. In the Scottish constitutional tradition, previous case law is said to be binding not, as in English law, by reason of its authority, but because of the authority of its reasoning. Miller on devolution does not stand up to scrutiny on this standard. But, on the devolution aspects, it is a unanimous 11 judge decision of the highest court in the land. Unless the Supreme Court is going to make more of a habit of sitting in plenary session en banc, its decision in Miller constitutes the final and binding word on these matters. By closing off the possibility of, even the threat of, recourse to the courts as a means of resolving constitutional disputes between the devolved nations and the United Kingdom Parliament or Government, the judgment will, if anything, exacerbate political tensions between them. This judgment has made the political constitution of the devolved United Kingdom as a whole more unstable, more brittle, more fragile and more likely to break-up precisely because it denies the devolved nations’ institutions any legal right to participate in the Brexit process.

The immediate political result of the Supreme Court’s judgment on what it considered to be the main issue (of the necessity for Westminster legislation to trigger Brexit) has been the publication by the United Kingdom Government, and its introduction before the United Kingdom Parliament, of The European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. This, in the terminology of German constitutional law, is an Ermächtigungsgestez or an “Enabling Act”. It consists of just one substantive sub-clause. This sub-clause provides for the United Kingdom Parliament to introduce into the United Kingdom constitution a new “leader principle” (the Germans always have a word for it) as follows:

The UK Supreme Court’s decision in the Miller appeal was probably greeted with a sigh of relief in 10 Downing Street. Sure, the Government will now need to seek parliamentary approval for triggering Article 50 TEU and starting the formal process of withdrawing from the EU, but the much greater political danger of having to also seek the consent of the devolved parliaments of Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales, has not materialised. What follows are a few brief comments on the Supreme Court’s reasoning and an assessment of its implications for the future.

The majority’s reasoning

The key question in the Miller case was whether the Government can rely on the Royal prerogative – i.e. an executive power historically vested in the monarch – in order to initiate the process of withdrawal from the EU or whether it can do this only after obtaining authorisation by an Act of Parliament. The majority of eight justices considered that generally speaking the prerogative entailed the conduct of the UK’s foreign affairs and therefore the power to conclude and terminate treaties. This was because the UK is a dualist country: treaties normally only become operational in domestic law where an Act of Parliament says so. Such an Act – and not the international treaty itself – becomes the source of the (international) law transposed. It follows that withdrawal from a treaty leaves unaffected the domestic situation, so that it, too, can be done on the basis of the Royal prerogative.

By contrast, as the majority in Miller argues, this is not the case as far as EU law is concerned. While the justices recognise at para 61 that this could be said ‘in one sense’, it would be ‘more realistic’ to say that EU law is not derived from the European Communities Act 1972, but from the EU institutions themselves. Instead of being the source of EU rights, the 1972 Act is a mere conduit for those rights, which form an independent source of domestic law in the UK. This is an important statement in that it recognises – very much echoing the ECJ’s van Gend en Loos judgment – that EU law is a new legal order and therefore not comparable to ‘normal’ Treaty law. The Supreme Court summarises the consequences of EU withdrawal neatly in paragraph 80 of the judgment:

[T]he 1972 Act effectively constitutes EU law as an entirely new, independent and overriding source of domestic law, and the Court of Justice as a source of binding judicial decisions about its meaning. This proposition is indeed inherent in the Secretary of State’s metaphor of the 1972 Act as a conduit pipe by which EU law is brought into the domestic UK law. Upon the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, EU law will cease to be a source of domestic law for the future […], decisions of the Court of Justice will […] be of no more than persuasive authority, and there will be no further references to that court from UK courts. Even those legal rules derived from EU law and transposed into UK law by domestic legislation will have a different status. They will no longer be paramount, but will be open to domestic repeal or amendment in ways that may be inconsistent with EU law.

This reasoning is convincing in that the Supreme Court recognises that the effects of EU law are unlike those of other sources of law – domestic or international. To allow the Government to effect these kinds of changes to the law without parliamentary authorisation would therefore have had profound and immediate consequences for individual rights, which is exactly something the Royal prerogative does not (and should not) entitle the executive to do.

More traditionally minded public lawyers will find some consolation in the judgment, however. Apart from the (dissenting) Lord Reed’s firm defence of the Government’s prerogative powers in para 177, the judgment makes short shrift of the arguments concerning the devolution settlement and in particular the Sewel Convention. The background to that convention is that Parliament retains the power to legislate on matters that have been devolved to the legislatures of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, but says that it ‘will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent’ of the devolved legislature concerned. For Scotland, this has recently been incorporated into s 28 (8) of the Scotland Act 1998.

The Supreme Court reiterated the traditional position that conventions embody political restrictions on the activities of Parliament, but that they are not law and cannot therefore adjudicated on. It then went on to say that the Sewel convention’s enactment in the Scotland Act does not make a difference in this regard: s 28 (8) merely entrenches the convention as a (political) convention and does not make it law. While this conclusion is supported by the legislative history of the Scotland Act, the consequence of this reasoning is that there would now appear to be two types of legislative provisions in UK primary law: those that can be adjudicated (i.e. law proper) and those that cannot (i.e. they are not really law). Readers may want to make up their minds as to whether this is good news for the principle of legal certainty.

Four implications of the Supreme Court’s judgment

First, the immediate consequence of the Supreme Court’s decision is that the Government will need an Act of Parliament – and nothing less will do – to empower it to trigger Article 50. There does not seem to be the political will amongst MPs or Lords to stop Brexit even though a majority of them backed ‘remain’. The main danger for the Government will therefore come from amendments, which MPs and Lords might try to include in order to force the Government to either subject the Brexit process to greater parliamentary scrutiny or to follow a certain course in the negotiations, e.g. to make every effort that the UK remains in the Single Market – something Theresa May has said she does not want. In order to make amendments difficult, the Government might put a one-clause Bill before Parliament, the appropriateness of which the Supreme Court was very clear about: ‘There is no equivalence between the constitutional importance of a statute, or any other document, and its length or complexity’.

Second, the consequences of the Supreme Court’s decision for future withdrawals from other treaties appear to be very limited. It is clearly tailored to the specific context of withdrawal from the EU with its supranational legal order. Hence a possible withdrawal from the ECHR – announced by Theresa May as a Tory party manifesto commitment for the 2020 general election – would probably be possible without parliamentary approval. And the same argument can be made with regard to Article 127 EEA case, which I have blogged on before: given that the EEA agreement is lacking the supranational features of the EU, the Government can serve a notice of withdrawal from that agreement without prior parliamentary authorisation. If the applicants in that case can get around this point somehow, however, the decision in Miller offers them a glimmer of hope on the question whether withdrawal from the EU implies withdrawal from the EEA: at para 115 the Supreme Court sat on the fence as regards the comparable question whether rights contained in the EP Elections Act 2002 were merely contingent on continued EU membership so that the loss of these rights would not in and of itself require parliamentary authorisation.

Third, the judgment does not say much about whether the final Brexit ‘deal’, i.e. the Treaty on withdrawal and possible treaties on transitional measures and a final trade deal, will need parliamentary approval though the Supreme Court pointed to the Ponsonby rule, which is now contained in s. 20 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 and requires that treaties signed by the executive ‘are laid before Parliament’ before they can be fully ratified.

Fourth, the judgment has implications for the future role of the Sewel Convention in the context of Brexit. On the one hand, it is now clear that it is not justiciable even in its s. 28 (8) incarnation. But on the other hand, the Supreme Court has not said expressly that the Sewel Convention would not apply here. Moreover, the Supreme Court has not closed the door to a broad understanding of the Convention, i.e. that it applies not only where Parliament legislates on matters for which the devolved legislatures are (also) competent, but that it applies also where the powers of the devolved legislatures are altered. Hence there is still a good argument to be made that the proposed Great Repeal Bill, which will aim to enact the EU acquis as domestic law, will trigger the Sewel convention. This is because it will enact parts of the EU acquis that have been devolved (e.g. on agriculture or the environment) and because it might already incorporate necessary changes to the limits of the powers of the devolved legislatures, which are currently unable to legislate contrary to EU law.

On the Sewel point the judgment is not necessarily bad news politically for the Scottish nationalists, who are in the governing party in Scotland. By holding that the Sewel convention is not justiciable, they can in the future be liberal at claiming that their parliament’s consent is needed for Westminster legislation without any authority being able to challenge them. And any instance on which they are not consulted, will be further evidence for their case that devolution within the UK is simply not enough. The Scottish First Minister’s reaction to the judgment gives us a flavour of things to come."

The results of the third nation-wide referendum in the United Kingdom are still sinking in at home and around the world. Just below 52% voted to leave the European Union, just over 48% voted to remain. The widespread conclusion is that the UK must leave the EU.

But there is another way of reading the result. The United Kingdom is not a centralised state. It is a ‘family of nations’. There is a strong case for arguing that the referendum carries only if a majority of voters in all four nations respectively give their backing. England and Wales voted to leave, but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain. Recognising that split is not a matter of shifting the goalposts after the fact. It is about respecting an established, indeed a compelling constitutional order.

Before Westminster politicians think about the practicalities of withdrawing from the EU, they urgently need to address the constitutional consequences. What is the overriding objective? To give legal effect to the will of the UK electorate as expressed in an advisory referendum? Or to preserve the United Kingdom, which is split 2:2?

The strongest case against EU withdrawal is that it is not in the UK’s interest. On that view, an overriding state interest is invoked not to disregard the will of the people, but to recognise that the result divides the constituent parts of the United Kingdom. Abrogation of the Scottish and Northern Irish results would violate the principle of formal co-equality among the four British nations. That stance almost eagerly invites Irish republicans to re-unify Ireland and Scottish nationalists to launch a second independence referendum.

Of course, if the overriding objective is to give legal effect to the overall numerical tally and withdraw from the EU, then the Westminster Parliament must first overcome several obstacles before it can dedicate itself completely to the Brexit negotiations. It must repeal the European Communities Act 1972 by which it became a member state. It must also amend the devolution legislation for Scotland and Northern Ireland. EU law is incorporated directly into the devolution statutes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Section 29(2)(d) of the Scotland Act 1998, for example, provides that acts of the Scottish Parliament that are incompatible with EU law are ‘not law’. A similar provision, section 6(2)(d), appears in the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Indeed, the status of the UK and Ireland as EU member states and signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights was fundamental to the negotiation of the Belfast or ‘Good Friday’ Agreement.

Amending the devolution legislation would be technically easy, but politically hazardous. It would add fuel to the fire stoked up by Scottish demands for independence. It would place ‘a bomb under the Irish peace process’. If Westminster is serious about Brexit it will have to terminate the devolution settlement it has so carefully crafted since before 1997. There is no way for Westminster to avoid negotiating with Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast in addition to Brussels, and there is no way for the UK as a whole to survive this process intact.

The integration of the devolved nations within the UK’s constitutional framework means that their consent needs to be sought. The 62% of voters in Scotland, and the 55.8% in Northern Ireland, who voted to remain EU members have turned their nations into veto powers. If either declines, the UK as a whole cannot proceed with Brexit negotiations in any constitutionally plausible way.

The United Kingdom is no longer a centralised state, if it ever was. The devolution arrangements have changed the UK’s constitutional settlement. The old Westminster axis of power has become diffuse through power-sharing agreements with Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast. People who voted Leave may ‘want their country back’, but their country has transformed over the last twenty years.

Under the current arrangements it would be perfectly possible for the family of four nations, acting collectively, to withdraw from the European Union. However, in the absence of unanimity and with awareness of a very delicate situation in Scotland and Northern Ireland, the next Prime Minister and the Westminster Parliament should not divert all political resources to make this purely advisory referendum legally binding. They must channel all resources to keep the Kingdom whole."

It presents a condensed version of their article in the August 2017 issue of the Journal of Private International Law. The blog post includes specific references to the actual journal article to enable the reader to branch off into the detailed discussion where relevant. It also takes account of recent developments in the Brexit negotiation that took place after the Journal article was completed.

On 1 October 2015, the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (‘Hague Convention’) entered into force in 28 Contracting States, including Mexico and all the Member States of the European Union, except Denmark. The Convention has applied between Singapore and the other Contracting States since 1 October 2016. China, Ukraine and the USA have signed the Convention indicating that they hope to ratify it in the future (see the official status table for the Convention on the Hague Conference on Private International Law’s website). The Brussels Ia Regulation, which is the European Union’s device for jurisdictional and enforcement matters, applies as of 10 January 2015 to legal proceedings instituted and to judgments rendered on or after that date. In addition to legal issues that may arise independently under the Hague Convention, some issues may manifest themselves at the interface between the Hague Convention and the Brussels Ia Regulation. Both sets of issues are likely to garner the attention of cross-border commercial litigators, transactional lawyers and private international law academics. The article examines anti-suit injunctions, concurrent proceedings and the implications of Brexit in the context of the Hague Convention and its relationship with the Brussels Ia Regulation. (See pages 387-389 of the article)

It is argued that the Hague Convention’s system of ‘qualified’ or ‘partial’ mutual trust may permit anti-suit injunctions, actions for damages for breach of exclusive jurisdiction agreements and anti-enforcement injunctions where such remedies further the objective of the Convention. (See pages 394-402 of the article) The text of the Hague Convention and the Explanatory Report by Professors Trevor Hartley and Masato Dogauchi are not explicit on this issue. However, the procès-verbal of the Diplomatic Session of the Hague Convention reveal widespread support for the proposition that the formal ‘process’ should be differentiated from the desired ‘outcome’ when considering whether anti-suit injunctions are permitted under the Convention. Where anti-suit injunctions uphold choice of court agreements and thus help achieve the intended ‘outcome’ of the Convention, there was a consensus among the official delegates at the Diplomatic Session that the Convention did not limit or constrain national courts of Contracting States from granting the remedy. (See Minutes No 9 of the Second Commission Meeting of Monday 20 June 2005 (morning) in Proceedings of the Twentieth Session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (Permanent Bureau of the Conference, Intersentia 2010) 622, 623–24) Conversely, where the remedy impedes the sound operation of the Convention by effectively derailing proceedings in the chosen court, there was also a consensus of the official delegates at the meeting that the Convention will not permit national courts of the Contracting States to grant anti-suit injunctions.

However, intra-EU Hague Convention cases may arguably not permit remedies for breach of exclusive choice of court agreements as they may be deemed to be an infringement of the principle of mutual trust and the principle of effectiveness of EU law (effet utile) which animate the multilateral jurisdiction and judgments order of the Brussels Ia Regulation (see pages 403-405 of the article; C-159/02 Turner v Grovit [2004] ECR I-3565). If an aggrieved party does not commence proceedings in the chosen forum or commences such proceedings after the non-chosen court has rendered a decision on the validity of the choice of court agreement, the recognition and enforcement of that ruling highlights an interesting contrast between the Brussels Ia Regulation and the Hague Convention. It appears that the non-chosen court’s decision on the validity of the choice of court agreement is entitled to recognition and enforcement under the Brussels Ia Regulation. (See C-456/11 Gothaer Allgemeine Versicherung AG v Samskip GmbH EU:C:2012:719, [2013] QB 548) The Hague Convention does not similarly protect the ruling of a non-chosen court. In fact, only a judgment given by a court of a Contracting State designated in an exclusive choice of court agreement shall be recognised and enforced in other Contracting States. (See Article 8(1) of the Hague Convention) Therefore, the ruling of a non-chosen court is not entitled to recognition and enforcement under the Hague Convention’s system of ‘qualified’ or ‘partial’ mutual trust. This provides a ready explanation for the compatibility of anti-suit injunctions with the Hague Convention but does not proceed any further to transpose the same conclusion into the very different context of the Brussels Ia Regulation which prioritizes the principle of mutual trust.

The dynamics of the relationship between Article 31(2) of the Brussels Ia Regulation and Articles 5 and 6 of the Hague Convention is mapped in the article (at pages 405-408). In a case where the Hague Convention should apply rather than the Brussels Ia Regulation because one of the parties is resident in a non-EU Contracting State to the Convention even though the chosen court is in a Member State of the EU (See Article 26(6)(a) of the Hague Convention) one would expect Article 6 of the Convention to be applied by any non-chosen court in the EU. However, the fundamental nature of the Article 31(2) lis pendens mechanism under the Brussels Ia Regulation may warrant the pursuance of a different line of analysis. (See Case C-452/12 Nipponkoa Insurance Co (Europe) Ltd v Interzuid Transport BV EU:C:2013:858, [2014] I.L.Pr. 10, [36]; See also to similar effect, Case C-533/08 TNT Express Nederland BV v AXA Versicherung AG EU:C:2010:243, [2010] I.L.Pr. 35, [49]) It is argued that the Hartley–Dogauchi Report’s interpretative approach has much to commend it as it follows the path of least resistance by narrowly construing the right to sue in a non-chosen forum as an exception rather than the norm. The exceptional nature of the right to sue in the non-chosen forum under the Hague Convention can be effectively reconciled with Article 31(2) of the Brussels Ia Regulation. This will usually result in the stay of the proceedings in the non-chosen court as soon as the chosen court is seised. As a consequence, the incidence of parallel proceedings and irreconcilable judgments are curbed, which are significant objectives in their own right under the Brussels Ia Regulation. It is hoped that the yet to develop jurisprudence of the CJEU on the emergent Hague Convention and the Brussels Ia Regulation will offer definitive and authoritative answers to the issues discussed in the article.

The implications of Brexit on this topic are not yet fully clear. (See pages 409-410 of the article) The UK is a party to the Hague Choice of Court Agreements Convention as a Member State of the EU, the latter having approved the Convention for all its Member States apart from Denmark. The UK will do what is necessary to remain a party to the Convention after Brexit. In its recently published negotiating paper – only available after the article in the Journal of Private International Law was completed – the UK Government has explicitly stated that:

“It is our intention to continue to be a leading member in the Hague Conference and to participate in those Hague Conventions to which we are already a party and those which we currently participate in by virtue of our membership of the EU.” (See Providing a cross-border civil judicial cooperation framework (PDF) at para 22)

The UK will no doubt avoid any break in the Convention’s application. Brexit will almost certainly see the end of the application of the Brussels Ia Regulation in the UK. The reason being that its uniform interpretation is secured by the CJEU through the preliminary ruling system under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The UK is not willing to accept that jurisdiction post-Brexit (“Leaving the EU will therefore bring an end to the direct jurisdiction of the CJEU in the UK, because the CJEU derives its jurisdiction and authority from the EU Treaties.” (See Providing a cross-border civil judicial cooperation framework at para 20) So although the UK negotiators are asking for a bespoke deal with the EU to continue something like Brussels Ia (“The UK will therefore seek an agreement with the EU that allows for close and comprehensive cross-border civil judicial cooperation on a reciprocal basis, which reflects closely the substantive principles of cooperation under the current EU framework”: see Providing a cross-border civil judicial cooperation framework at para 19) it seems improbable that the EU will agree to such a bespoke deal just with the UK when the UK does not accept the CJEU preliminary ruling system. The EU may well say that the option for close partners of the EU in this field is the Lugano Convention. The UK Government has indicated that it would like to remain part of the Lugano Convention (see Providing a cross-border civil judicial cooperation framework at para 22). In doing so it would continue to mandate the UK courts to take account of the jurisprudence of the CJEU -when that court is interpreting Brussels Ia or the Lugano Convention – when UK courts are interpreting the Lugano Convention (see the opaque statement by the UK Government that “the UK and the EU will need to ensure future civil judicial cooperation takes into account regional legal arrangements, including the fact that the CJEU will remain the ultimate arbiter of EU law within the EU.” see Providing a cross-border civil judicial cooperation framework at para 20). However, unless the Lugano Convention is renegotiated it does not contain a good solution in relation to conflicts of jurisdiction for exclusive choice of court agreements because it has not been amended to reflect Article 31(2) of Brussels Ia and therefore still gives priority to the non-chosen court when it is seised first and the exclusively chosen court is seised second in accordance with the Gasser decision of the CJEU (see Case C-116/02 [2003] ECR I-14693). Renegotiation of the Lugano Convention is not even on the agenda at the moment although the Gasser problem may be discussed at the Experts’ Meeting pursuant to Article 5 Protocol 2 of the Lugano Convention on 16 and 17 October 2017 in Basel, Switzerland (Professor Beaumont is attending that meeting as an invited expert). Revision of the Lugano Convention would be a good thing, as would Norway and Switzerland becoming parties to the Hague Convention. It seems that at least until the Lugano Convention is revised and a means is found for the UK to be a party to it (difficult if the UK does not stay in EFTA), the likely outcome post-Brexit is that the regime applicable between the UK and the EU (apart from Denmark) in relation to exclusive choice of court agreements within the scope of the Hague Convention will be the Hague Convention. The UK will be able to grant anti-suit injunctions to uphold exclusive choice of court agreements in favour of the courts in the UK even when one of the parties has brought an action contrary to that agreement in an EU Member State. The EU Member States will apply Article 6 of the Hague Convention rather than Article 31(2) of the Brussels Ia Regulation when deciding whether to decline jurisdiction in favour of the chosen court(s) in the UK.

Whilst the Hague Convention only offers a comprehensive jurisdictional regime for cases involving exclusive choice of court agreements, it does give substantial protection to the jurisdiction of UK courts designated in such an agreement which will be respected in the rest of the EU regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. Post-Brexit the recognition and enforcement regime for judgments not falling within the scope of the Hague Choice of Court Agreements Convention could be the new Hague Judgments Convention currently being negotiated in The Hague (see Working Paper No. 2016/3- Respecting Reverse Subsidiarity as an excellent strategy for the European Union at The Hague Conference on Private International Law – reflections in the context of the Judgments Project? by Paul Beaumont). Professor Beaumont will continue to be a part of the EU Negotiating team for that Convention at the Special Commission in the Hague from 13-17 November 2017. It is to be welcomed that the UK Government has affirmed its commitment to an internationalist and not just a regional approach to civil judicial co-operation:

“The UK is committed to increasing international civil judicial cooperation with third parties through our active participation in the Hague Conference on Private International Law and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law… We will continue to be an active and supportive member of these bodies, as we are clear on the value of international and intergovernmental cooperation in this area.” See Providing a cross-border civil judicial cooperation framework at para 21.

One good thing that could come from Brexit is the powerful combination of the EU and the UK both adopting a truly internationalist perspective in the Hague Conference on Private International Law in order to genuinely enhance civil judicial co-operation throughout the world. The UK can be one of the leaders of the common law world while using its decades of experience of European co-operation to help build bridges to the civil law countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America."

The present author believes that only an Act of Parliament can be used to invoke Article 50 but if I am mistaken then a very interesting route to Scottish independence potentially opens up.

If the UK government were to persist in arguing that the Prerogative can be used to trigger Article 50 and that submission were to be upheld by the courts then that will logically lead to a conclusion that Westminster will not welcome: that the Prerogative can be used to dissolve the Union between Scotland and England.

To understand why we must look at the often overlooked legal mechanics of the union between Scotland and England because there is a strong analogy with the Articles of Union 1706 and the Acts of Union 1707 and the Treaty of Accession to the EC and the European Communities Act

Creating and Dissolving Unions: International Treaties and Acts of Parliament

The terms “Articles or Treaty of Union” on the one hand and “Acts of Union” tend to be used interchangeably by authors discussing the Union of Parliaments, for the understandable reasons that their substantive texts are the same, however legally they are quite different types of document. The Articles of Union signed on 2 July 1706 were an international treaty agreed between the two sovereign kingdoms of England and Scotland with the respective negotiating “teams” acting under the prerogative. However, this 2 July treaty did not create the Union of Scotland and England any more than the accession treaty on 22 January 1972 between UK, Denmark and Ireland with the existing EC members signed by the then Prime Minster, Ted Heath, made the UK a member of the Common Market. The UK only became a member of the EC after the European Communities Act 1972 had been passed on 17 October 1972 and came into effect on 1 January 1973. Likewise, Scotland and England were not conjoined until the passing of both the English and Scots Acts of Union which ratified the Articles of Union of 1706. This distinction between treaty and act is made very clear in the preamble to the 1707 (Scots) statute:

Whereas Articles of Union were agreed on the Twenty Second day of July in the Fifth year of Your Majesties reign by the Commissioners nominated on behalf of the Kingdom of England under Your Majesties Great Seal of England bearing date at Westminster the Tenth day of April then last past in pursuance of an Act of Parliament made in England in the Third year of Your Majesties reign and the Commissioners nominated on the behalf of the Kingdom of Scotland under Your Majesties Great Seal of Scotland bearing date the Twenty Seventh day of February in the Fourth year of Your Majesties Reign in pursuance of the Fourth Act of the Third Session of the present Parliament of Scotland to treat of and concerning an Union of the said Kingdoms

If it is correct that the mere use of the Royal Prerogative is sufficient legal authority to trigger Article 50 of the TEU and so revoke and repeal the European Communities Act 1972 then it would seem to follow by analogy that the Royal Prerogative could be used to in the context of Scotland leaving the UK, because it is submitted that if the Prerogative can be used to invoke Article 50 which is not an international treaty but part of the domestic law and so effectively repeal the European Communities act 1972 the same process could be used by the Scots government to revoke the Scots Act of Union of 1707.

This could be by the Scottish Government using the Prerogative power to revoke the international treaty (the Articles of Union) and thence by implied repeal revoke the Act of Union. This in turn naturally raises the question of whether the Scottish First Minister could use the Prerogative in this way.

In principle I do not see why this would not be possible.

First, the pre-1707 Scots monarch enjoyed the Prerogative and the Articles of Union were made under the prerogative.

Second, the post-devolution Scots monarch is bound by the advice she receives from the Scottish Government.

If the Scottish Parliament, after a referendum vote for independence, passed an Act instructing the First Minister to revoke the Articles of Union or if the First Minister were simply to use her right to advise the crown, the sovereign would be obliged to comply. Once the Articles are revoked, so too would the Act of Union be revoked. Thus Scotland could leave the Union without the permission of the Westminster Parliament and Westminster could not stop it!

Readers of this post will be wondering how this works in terms of the devolution settlement. Is the constitution not a reserved matter under the Scotland Act 1998? Let us consider the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act, namely section 30 and Schedule 5.

SCHEDULE 5 Reserved matters

Part I General reservations

The Constitution

1 The following aspects of the constitution are reserved matters, that is—

(a) the Crown, including succession to the Crown and a regency,

(b) the Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England,

(c) the Parliament of the United Kingdom,

(d) the continued existence of the High Court of Justiciary as a criminal court of first instance and of appeal,

(e) the continued existence of the Court of Session as a civil court of first instance and of appeal.

2(1) Paragraph 1 does not reserve —

(a) Her Majesty’s prerogative and other executive functions,

(b) functions exercisable by any person acting on behalf of the Crown, or

(c) any office in the Scottish Administration.

Note that under paragraph 2(1)(a) the Prerogative is expressly declared not to be reserved. Therefore there seems nothing in law to prevent the Scottish Government exercising their Prerogative powers to revoke the Articles of Union and hence the Act of Union!

Perhaps those arguing in favour of the Prerogative’s role in the UK exiting the EU should think carefully about its potential role in Scotland exiting the UK, as the royal prerogative might be an equally powerful means for the Scots people to leave the UK. This analysis of the Prerogative would allow Scotland to leave the UK without the permission of the British Government and Parliament. A sovereign people would thus achieve their independence by means of the prerogative powers of their sovereign.

Will it really happen? When will it happen? Will the continuing EU play hardball in negotiations or will it seek to ensure that the UK becomes a good neighbour? What will the post-Brexit UK and EU look like? One decision for those entering into cross border commercial contracts in the post-referendum legal landscape is what to do about an English jurisdiction provision in the contract. The referendum result hasn’t itself changed anything legally, but it may be necessary to invoke these jurisdiction provisions of a contract in two or more years’ time, when the legal framework might be different.

Jurisdictional Principles

The jurisdiction of the English courts and the courts of other EU Member States in civil and commercial matters is currently governed by the Brussels I Regulation (Recast) or the Recast Regulation (EU Regulation 1215/2012). The Regulation provides that a choice of jurisdiction by the parties should be upheld and that judgments given by the courts of one Member State should be enforced in all other Member States. After Brexit, the Recast Regulation will in all probability cease to apply to the UK, which has led some lawyers in continuing EU Member States to promote the idea that commercial litigation that might have traditionally come to the English courts should instead be diverted to the other emerging European centres of international litigation. English lawyers are naturally perturbed by such a prospect. What the post-Brexit jurisdictional and enforcement landscape will look like is uncertain. Lawyers can debate enthusiastically whether judgments given in proceedings commenced before Brexit will continue to be enforceable after Brexit, whether the 1968 Brussels Convention will be restored, whether the pre-Brussels Convention bilateral treaties between the UK and individual Member States will revive, whether the UK has a right to adhere to the Lugano Convention or, if not, whether one or more of the existing Contracting States will block the UK’s doing so. Interesting though those debates will be, they do not reduce the uncertainty and offer scant help to those who must make a decision now.

The Starting Point on Jurisdiction

The first question is what the jurisdiction agreement in any particular contract is trying to achieve. If a fundamental objective of the jurisdiction clause is to provide a judgment that will be enforceable throughout the EU, then the uncertainties of the post-referendum world come into play (as illustrated in this earlier post by Dr. Jon Fitchen). There is a real risk that, with the departure of the Recast Regulation and the uncertainties over Lugano and other issues, an English judgment will not be readily enforceable in the continuing EU and vice versa. Possible responses where enforceability of a judgment in the continuing EU is an important factor are discussed below.

There are, however, many reasons for a choice of jurisdiction save for the enforceability of the resulting judgment within the continuing EU. For example, the party against whom enforcement is likely to be required may not have any accessible assets in the EU. Most obviously, the party might have assets in the UK or otherwise outside the EU, in which case the issues will be the same pre-Brexit as post-Brexit. In some instances, enforceability might not be a major issue. For instance, a party may have sufficient security against which to discharge its counterparty’s obligations within the jurisdiction. Or a party may conclude that it is more likely to be the sued rather than sue the counterparty. Or enforcement risk may simply not be a big factor for the particular counterparty. In these situations, a jurisdiction clause may fulfil a more defensive role of ensuring that the party can only be sued in a court in which it has confidence. If so, again the considerations may not have changed significantly as a result of the referendum vote. Post-Brexit, a jurisdiction clause in favour of the English courts may not require courts in EU Member States to defer to the English courts in quite the same way or for the same reasons as now, but the counter may be that, if so, the English courts will, contrary to the current position, be able to grant anti-suit injunctions to restrain a party from pursuing proceedings in an EU court. A party with any business, presence or assets in the UK cannot afford to ignore an injunction.

EU Enforceability: Solutions

If enforceability of a judgment throughout the continuing EU is important, there are four solutions in circumstances where, pre-referendum, jurisdiction would have been given to the English courts.

First, give jurisdiction to the courts of an EU Member State or a Lugano Convention Contracting State (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland). This depends upon being comfortable with proceedings in that court, including as to its procedures, costs, speed and outcomes. This is already sometimes done in, for example, security agreements where the security in question is located in another EU Member State.

Second, give non-exclusive jurisdiction to the English courts. This cautious approach hedges the parties’ choice of jurisdiction and allows the position to be reconsidered at the time when legal proceedings are commenced. If at that time enforcement remains important and an English judgment is enforceable in the EU, then the English courts can be used; if, however, an English judgment is not enforceable in the EU, it will allow the use of other courts. A variant of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses is the asymmetric or unilateral jurisdiction agreement, which is commonly used in cross border finance contracts. This binds one party to sue exclusively in the primary non-exclusive forum, but allows the other party to commence proceedings in that court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction. The French Cour de cassation has cast some doubt on the validity of these clauses under Article 23 of the Brussels I Regulation in Mme X v Rothschild (26 September 2012) and Article 23 of the Lugano Convention in ICH v Credit Suisse (25 March 2015). However, the position has been somewhat ameliorated by the most recent Cour de cassation decision in Apple Sales International v eBizcuss (7 October 2015). Moreover, doubt as to a matter of EU law may be less significant if the UK is outside the EU because the English courts have traditionally enforced these clauses. It could, however, affect EU Member States’ courts’ approach to the jurisdiction clause, but that is in any event a matter of some uncertainty until finally resolved by the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Third, arbitration is a possibility. Arbitration is already commonly used if enforcement is important and the counterparty has assets in a location where an English judgment is not enforceable because of the extensive reach of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. All EU Member States are parties to the New York Convention, which provides for the enforcement in participating states of an arbitral award given in another participating state. An arbitration seated in a participating state, whether the UK, a continuing EU Member State or elsewhere, should therefore be able to give an award enforceable throughout the EU.

Fourth, parties could continue with whatever their current policy is. The massive uncertainties surrounding what Brexit will bring could be treated as meaning that the risks of change are as great as the risks of no change.

EU Enforceability: The Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements

There is another possible solution to the problem of enforceability of a judgment throughout the EU. This is to give the English courts exclusive jurisdiction. The potential benefits of this route arise because the EU is a party to the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements. In addition to the EU, Mexico and most recently Singapore have signed and ratified the Convention, which is therefore currently of limited significance in global terms. The Convention does, however, provide that all Contracting States must give effect to exclusive jurisdiction agreements (Articles 5 and 6) and enforce the resulting judgment given by the chosen court (Article 8). The UK is not currently an individual Contracting State to the Convention because the Convention’s subject matter falls within the exclusive competence of the EU. There is divided academic opinion on the issue whether the UK is bound by this international treaty post-Brexit without any need for the UK to ratify the treaty afresh as it might be argued that the UK is only bound by the treaty while it is a Member State of the EU. Assuming the UK would not be bound, the UK would still be entitled to sign and ratify the Convention in order to bring it into force immediately on the UK’s leaving the EU or soon afterwards; the consent of the existing parties is not required. If the UK were to do so, a judgment given by an English court that has taken jurisdiction under an exclusive jurisdiction clause will again be enforceable throughout the EU. This position is not, however, without potential transitional wrinkles. Article 16 of the Convention states the Convention applies to exclusive jurisdiction agreements concluded after its entry into force for the state of the chosen court and that the Convention does not apply to proceedings instituted before its entry into force in the state of the court seised. The Convention has, however, already entered into force in the UK because of the EU’s ratification of the Convention.

Suppose that a contract contains an English exclusive jurisdiction clause but that, post-Brexit, a court in an EU Member State is seised of proceedings falling within the scope of that clause. What will the EU Member State’s court do, assuming that the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements is not applicable?

Post-Brexit, so far as the continuing EU is concerned the English courts will (subject to any future contrary arrangements with the EU) be in the same position as any other courts outside the EU. The commercial expectation might be that the courts of EU Member States would give effect to the parties’ wishes, but it is not entirely clear that this will necessarily be the case. Article 33 of the Recast Regulation provides that courts in EU Member States may stay proceedings in favour of courts outside the EU if three conditions are met: first, the non-EU court was first seised; secondly, the non-EU court can give a judgment capable of enforcement in the EU Member State in question; and, thirdly, a stay is necessary for the proper administration of justice. If these three conditions are met, then the court in the EU Member State can stay, and might generally be expected to stay, proceedings in favour of the court outside the EU. But what if any of these conditions is not met (for example, because the court in the EU Member State was seised first)? It is arguable that, despite the fact that the agreement between the parties has been broken by one party starting proceedings in an EU Member State’s courts, the courts of EU Member States cannot stay their proceedings in favour of the non-EU court. Before Article 33 was added to the Recast Regulation, there was no explicit provision addressing the position of non-EU courts. There is evidence of some Member State court’s practice which gives effect to jurisdiction agreements in favour of non-EU courts under the guise of giving ‘reflexive effect’ to the Regulation’s provisions regarding jurisdiction clauses. However, as the Recast Regulation now specifically addresses the position of non-EU courts, the convenient legal fiction of the doctrine of reflexive effect may be harder to justify in principle.

Ultimately, the Court of Justice of the European Union will have to determine the most appropriate approach in these circumstances. Even if the courts of an EU Member State consider that they have no power to stay proceedings in favour of the English courts despite an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the English courts, the English courts may not be without a pragmatic remedy. Under the Recast Regulation, the English courts cannot grant an anti-suit injunction to restrain a party from pursuing proceedings in the courts of another EU Member State bought in breach of the jurisdiction agreement (Case C-159/02 Turner v Grovit [2004] ECR I-03565). However, if the UK is no longer an EU Member State, its mutual trust constraints will no longer apply and the English courts would again be free to grant, and would generally grant, anti-suit injunctions ordering parties to stop legal proceedings brought in breach of contract. Failure to obey an injunction would constitute contempt of court, which could lead to a fine, imprisonment and, ultimately, sequestration of assets. A party with any presence or assets in the UK would have to comply with the injunction or reconcile itself to the loss of those assets. If, contrary to the assumption made above, the Convention was applicable, the courts of an EU Member State that are seised of proceedings in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction agreement should defer to the English courts according to Article 6 of the Convention. Moreover, the Convention’s system of qualified mutual trust may also permit the use of anti-suit injunctions, the damages remedy for breach of exclusive jurisdiction agreements and anti-enforcement injunctions where such relief furthers the objective of the Convention.

One such problem concerns the effect of Brexit on existing private international law, also known as ‘conflict of laws’, in the UK. These are issues of particular interest and concern to the School of Law, especially those in the University of Aberdeen’s Centre for Private International Law. This interest is not simply an academic one, as our colleagues have at various times directly advised on and participated in the development of the law in this area.

Private international law (PIL) deals with questions that arise when a civil case between private parties also involves a foreign element. PIL provides the answers to basic legal questions arising from the foreign element including:

Can I bring my case before my local court (or not)?

If I can do so, what law should be applied to the dispute by that court?

If I win, can I get my judgment enforced abroad?

Does any earlier or competing foreign litigation affect or stop my case?

The EU has put in place many PIL Regulations to replace the different complex national answers to these basic questions with harmonised answers (in different Regulations) applying across all (or very nearly all) EU Member States. These PIL Regulations simplify the otherwise very complex interactions of different systems of PIL (each with different approaches to, and answers for, the questions noted above) and also simplify many of the complex legal issues arising in PIL that affect the lives of ordinary private individuals and businesses in Scotland, England and Wales and Northern Ireland.

Given our present dependency in the UK on EU PIL Regulations, the effect of a ‘clean-break’ Brexit on PIL in England and Wales, in Scotland and in Northern Ireland will be profound: the EU PIL Regulations that provide many aspects of what we in the UK presently understood to be ‘our’ private international law will cease to apply unless positive legislative action is taken by the Scottish Government (PIL is a devolved matter) and by the Westminster Government to off-set this eventuality post Brexit. This might sound technical (it is) and abstract (it isn’t) but the basic point as it concerns the cross-border enforcement of ‘UK’ judgments in the rest of the EU can be simply illustrated with a before and after example.

Example

FACTS – An English company sells goods to a German company. The contract calls for the German company to collect the goods from the factory in England with payment due within one week of collection: though this arrangement has worked well in the past, this time the English company is not paid by the due date. The English company goes to the English court and wins a judgment that obliges the German company to pay it the money due and also its costs. The problem is that the goods and the German company are both in Germany.

NOW – The English Company can quickly and cheaply automatically enforce the English judgment against the German company using the EU’s Brussels Ia Regulation (Regulation 1215/2012): there is no need to go to court in Germany to ask permission to enforce because the EU Regulation means that the incoming UK judgment has to be treated as if it is an enforceable German one. The EU’s Brussels Ia Regulation has streamlined the enforcement process by presuming that the foreign (English) judgment is valid (etc.) and by reducing to an absolute minimum any possibility of the German company challenging the enforcement of the UK judgment in Germany.

AFTER BREXIT – The EU’s Brussels Ia Regulation will no longer technically apply to the English claim, nor to the overseas enforcement of the English Judgment as far as the other 27 EU Member States are concerned. If nothing has been done by the Scottish and Westminster Governments to avoid this prior to Brexit, it will be necessary for the English company to hire German lawyers to ask the German court to decide that the English judgment is capable of being recognised as a foreign judgment by the non-Brussels Ia PIL rules of the German legal system and then, assuming that the English judgment is so recognised, that it is then capable of actual enforcement in Germany. No part of this procedure will be automatic and neither will there be any presumptions that the English judgment is valid. It may well be possible that the enforcement of the English judgment will be obstructed by the un-harmonised German PIL enforcement law. Though post Brexit the precise outcome and legal costs of this example will vary from one EU State to another it is plain that enforcing such a judgment from the UK without the possibility of having recourse to the benefits offered by the EU’s PIL Regulations will take longer and cost more than it does at present.

So what is to be done?

There is no simple solution to the basic problem that many important areas of ‘our’ PIL in the UK are currently contained in EU Regulations that will, unless action is taken by the Scottish and Westminster Governments, seemingly cease to apply immediately the UK leaves the EU. The seriousness of the issue extends much further than the business dispute in the example above as different EU PIL Regulations presently govern matters as diverse as:

cross-border family law (including parental responsibility for children and the payment of maintenance);

cross-border civil claims and commercial claims;

cross-border insolvencies;

what law will be applicable to cross-border disputes over contracts or over tort / delict claims.

If these numerous EU Regulations are allowed to cease to apply at the end of the day before Brexit, we will find ourselves thrown back on domestic civil procedure rules that assume that the EU PIL Regulations still apply when in fact they do not do so: if the legislators do not act to prevent it, the delays, costs and legal problems associated with this uncomfortable reality will become plain whenever a UK judgment concerning a matter formerly governed by an EU PIL Regulation is presented for enforcement elsewhere in the EU.

Some glimmers of hope?

It may be that the legislators in the UK will consult on this matter and then act to minimise the PIL risks of Brexit for their citizens. The Brexit negotiations could – if the matter is placed high enough up on the agendas of each side and is pursued with sufficient determination by the UK – lead to the UK being able to retain the benefits of some of the existing EU PIL Regulations on some sort of a reciprocal basis by also allowing those in the 27 State version of the EU the possibility of using their EU PIL ‘rights’ within the post-Brexit UK.

The UK will replace some EU PIL with PIL derived from Hague PIL Conventions that the UK is already a party to and these Conventions will apply between the UK and the EU (apart from Denmark, in some cases). These Conventions cover child abduction, inter-country adoption, parental responsibility, access, maintenance for children and spouses and exclusive choice of court agreements in commercial cases. There is also the longer term possibility that the ongoing work on the planned global Hague Judgments Convention will succeed (it has already had its first Special Commission in June 2016) and deal with the problem of getting UK judgments recognised in EU States and indeed elsewhere in the world.

What next?

The Scottish Government, the Westminster Government and the representatives in Northern Ireland need to appreciate the nature of the looming private international law problems and to formulate effective strategies to protect their citizens and businesses from the impending uncertainty. The University of Aberdeen’s Centre for Private International Law is looking forward to contributing to that task.

Addendum

The Centre for Private International Law has just published a working paper entitled “Respecting Reverse Subsidiarity is an excellent strategy for the European Union at The Hague Conference on Private International Law: currently being well deployed in the Judgments Project“, by Professor Paul Beaumont. It also considers some implications of Brexit. The final version of that paper will be published in a Polish review: Europejski Przegląd Sądowy, 2016, issue 10 (which translates as “European Judicial Review”).

The UK Government has allowed the other 27 Member States of the EU and the European Parliament to effectively set the agenda for the entire Brexit negotiations. Now the UK is trying to vary that agenda by arguments advanced in several position papers. Among the issues dealt with by these position papers is the UK’s wish to end the ‘jurisdiction’ of the CJEU over the UK and its laws: this post is concerned with this issue and the UK’s position on CJEU ‘jurisdiction’

The CJEU ‘red-line’

Whether one is (or was) for or against Brexit, the UK’s red-line position concerning the CJEU has been confused and confusing ever since Prime Minister May indicated that she interpreted the Leave vote to mean (in part) that we had to, ‘… bring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Britain’. The confusion arose not only from the perplexing use of the term ‘jurisdiction’ to describe the very limited opportunities for the CJEU to exercise any influence over ‘British’ laws while we are members of the EU, but also from the glaring contradiction in professing this wish while planning to ‘cut and paste’ vast swathes of EU law (including the majority of the decisions of the CJEU) into domestic ‘UK’ laws such that only the UK’s Supreme Court could even hypothetically contemplate a post-Brexit overruling of a CJEU decision within the UK. It seems very strange to try to escape something that no lawyer would regard as an existing CJEU jurisdiction over UK law and courts by compelling every ‘liberated’ UK court (except the UK Supreme Court) to then follow slavishly pre-Brexit CJEU decisions.

The UK sought to resolve one aspect of this confusion in its 13 July policy paper ‘Converting and Preserving Law’ (PDF) on the intended Repeal Bill; this indicated (sensibly) that the Repeal Bill would not compel UK courts to follow CJEU rulings, but would instead allow them to take CJEU decisions into account in reaching their own decisions. This clarification has however been undermined by the publication of the UK’s ‘Enforcement and Dispute Resolution’ paper on 23 August which (at paragraph 45) repeats that decisions of the CJEU will have the same status as decisions of the UK Supreme Court (i.e. will bind every UK court other than the Supreme Court).

Clarifying the ‘jurisdiction’ of the CJEU?

The August position paper additionally tries to resolve uncertainties including those arising from the UK’s political soundbites concerning the end of the so-called ‘jurisdiction’ of the CJEU in Britain. What does jurisdiction mean? At its simplest, ‘jurisdiction’ (understood about a court) defines aspects of that court’s lawful power to act: if the court has no jurisdiction it cannot act and must reject the case. Thus, can a given court hear a case valued at £3,000 or less? Can a given court entertain a given type of case? We would not wish to send cases on technical aspects of construction law to a court specialising in family law matters (etc.). A further type of jurisdiction concerns the types of actions or procedures that may be brought before a given court. With the greatest of respect to those who have clamoured for the end of the so-called jurisdiction of the CJEU over ‘British’ law (i.e. the different laws of England and Wales; Scotland; and Northern Ireland), the Member States have never given the CJEU an independent ability to act in relation to the application of any law by a Member State court. The most that can be said in this respect is that if (and only if) a court in a given Member State decides to ask the CJEU to clarify the interpretation of an aspect of EU law which clashes with a principle of domestic law, the decision of the CJEU on this matter will be binding on all Member State courts. It is important to notice two further points; first, the CJEU might decide that there is no clash and dismiss the application without affecting domestic law at all, second, it is always for the national court to apply the CJEU’s decision to the facts of the case. At no point have the EU’s Member States given (nor wished to give) the CJEU any independent jurisdiction over their domestic laws.

The post-Brexit direct jurisdiction of the CJEU

When the UK leaves the EU, it will naturally no longer be possible for the UK’s courts to refer questions of law to the CJEU because the UK will not be a Member State; this is elementary and therefore raises the question of what does the UK mean by ending the ‘direct jurisdiction’ of the CJEU? This is the clarification offered by the August position paper. The UK wishes to end the ‘direct jurisdiction’ of the CJEU in Britain post-Brexit. It may be that this is an attempt to indicate that the UK is willing to entertain some future ‘indirect’ role for the CJEU in its laws post Brexit (there might be some negotiating value in attempting such a gambit in certain situations). That said, the main aim of the UK’s position paper appears to be to try to dislodge the CJEU from playing any role in the administration or interpretation of the withdrawal agreement or its contents: this UK wish is understandable, but comes very late in the day and long after the EU’s agenda documents have been published (complete with significant default roles for the CJEU at various points in the Brexit processes).

Other options than the CJEU, the EFTA court

The UK rightly suggests that there are viable post-Brexit alternatives to relying on the CJEU to administer the withdrawal agreement or to police matters involving EU citizens’ rights (which the UK argues the domestic courts in the UK can adequately protect). The UK’s position on this matter seems instinctively correct: how can the UK leave the EU but still somehow be involuntarily subject to its laws? The EU’s default negotiating position on these matters is thus open to objections based on political reality and sovereignty. These arguments have been noticed by even current and former judges of the CJEU. (Strong criticism of the EU negotiating position on attempting to continue EU law and CJEU influence in the UK post-Brexit has been expressed by F. Dehousse (former CJEU judge for Belgium), and on 9 August The Times reported (£) that Koen Lenaerts (the President of the European Court of Justice) suggested the EFTA court could resolve withdrawal agreement or other disputes between the EU and UK post Brexit. That said, the EU’s default position does allow for the possibility of a different court/body than the CJEU acting in some circumstances to regulate post-Brexit UK EU relations. One difficulty is that the UK has left it very late to engage with the EU on this matter: The countdown to 29 March 2019 (two years after the triggering of the Article 50 EU exit mechanism) ticks away. A further difficulty is that the UK seems quite lukewarm in its position paper to the obvious judicial alternative to the EU’s CJEU, the EFTA court. (An overview of the EFTA court as an option can be found here.) As a rule in negotiations it is a bad idea to offer an objection to an agenda item without a viable ‘plug-in-and-play’ solution. A further potential risk of attempting to entirely dislodge the CJEU from the Brexit process is found in Article 218(11) TFEU:

‘A Member State, the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission may obtain the opinion of the Court of Justice as to whether an agreement envisaged is compatible with the Treaties.’

If the CJEU is asked such a question, and then renders an adverse opinion, the agreement cannot enter into force unless it is amended. Article 218(11) has seen the EU prevented from joining the European Convention on Human Rights by the CJEU because of the inevitable demotion of the Luxembourg based CJEU in any Human Rights case potentially heading to the Strasbourg Human Rights Court (per its Opinion 2/13 of 18 December 2014). The UK should be careful that, having triggered the countdown to departure from the EU and having been out-manoeuvred by the elephantine EU in setting the agenda, it does not then so focus on bypassing the CJEU as to accidentally create a withdrawal agreement that the CJEU can de-rail via Article 218(11) TFEU leaving us dangling over a Brexit cliff-edge on 30 March 2019.

So too would the possible repeal of the Human Rights Act 1998, perhaps to be replaced by a Bill of Rights. One implication relates to proposals I put forward in my 2012 monograph Access to Essential Innovation and Technology: Intellectual Property, Human Rights and Competition.

These three legal fields of intellectual property (“IP”), human rights and competition were combined in the book as they can be relevant to questions of access to technologies from different perspectives.

Taking access to medicines as an example:

IP encourages the developing of new medicines by conferring exclusive rights and the ability to charge licensing fees;

the right to life indicates that there should be access to medicines, without money being an obstacle; and

competition law, in its prohibition on abuse of a dominant position, objects to an IP owner having too much power.

It is of course possible for these three fields to co-exist and complement each other: IP develops medicines to further the right to life and rewards the activities of innovators, and the ultimate goal of both IP and competition has been argued to be to encourage innovation. Yet conflict is possible; and this can be entrenched by the fact that within the UK jurisdictions there are significant differences in the extent to which each field can be the base of an action.

The book developed a means of enabling these three legal fields to be combined in judicial decision making in the UK, to deliver greater access to technology while still respecting the contribution which IP can make to developing innovation. At the heart of the book’s proposals are firstly a Human Rights Emphasis, which is a framework for enabling courts to consider the wide range of human rights relevant to a dispute to establish what is meant by delivering decisions (in light of the Human Rights Act 1998 and also EU fundamental rights) which are “consistent with human rights”; and secondly there is a new, human rights influenced, approach to the “Euro-defence” (a term explored in this resource from the law firm Slaughter and may (PDF)) and the case law on when refusal to license IP could be an abuse of a dominant position. These two approaches could lead to courts, in some cases, finding that what seemed to be IP infringement from a pure IP law perspective was not in fact so. The book then went on to argue that this approach was consistent with UK’s responsibilities to IP owners under the European Convention on Human Rights, and also obligations to protect IP under TRIPS, the IP element of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) Agreement. As a result, the approach and the UK would not be vulnerable to challenge at the European Court of Human Rights and through WTO dispute settlement.

The book develops its arguments through several scenarios, across health, communications, and the environment, with a range of outcomes depending on the facts. The proposals have been well reviewed (and also termed “possibly heretical” (Stothers 2013)) and stimulated wide interest among lawyers and IP owners, notably at the Licensing Executive Society International Conference in 2011.

Looking forward it does seem possible that there will be some sort of a Bill of Rights and also be some sort of competition law framework in post-Brexit UK, yet in these new regimes human rights and competition may not have their present special legal status that has enabled the societal objectives (other than short term reward of innovation) to prevail.

My ongoing work (including blog posts of 26 November 2015, 2 May 2016, and 26 July 2016) explores how the interaction between legal fields can be further developed, including by looking beyond the Human Rights Act 1998 and EU competition law. (This could be serendipitous, given the current political situation.) For now, the arguments developed remain a valuable tool for experimentation by lawyers and activists who are faced with IP obstacles to using technologies to pursue important goals.

The blog post includes specific references to the actual journal article to enable the reader to branch off into the detailed discussion where relevant. It also takes account of recent developments in the Brexit negotiation that took place after the Journal article was completed.

On 1 October 2015, the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (‘Hague Convention’) entered into force in 28 Contracting States, including Mexico and all the Member States of the European Union, except Denmark. The Convention has applied between Singapore and the other Contracting States since 1 October 2016. China, Ukraine and the USA have signed the Convention indicating that they hope to ratify it in the future (see the official status table for the Convention on the Hague Conference on Private International Law’s website). The Brussels Ia Regulation, which is the European Union’s device for jurisdictional and enforcement matters, applies as of 10 January 2015 to legal proceedings instituted and to judgments rendered on or after that date. In addition to legal issues that may arise independently under the Hague Convention, some issues may manifest themselves at the interface between the Hague Convention and the Brussels Ia Regulation. Both sets of issues are likely to garner the attention of cross-border commercial litigators, transactional lawyers and private international law academics. The article examines anti-suit injunctions, concurrent proceedings and the implications of Brexit in the context of the Hague Convention and its relationship with the Brussels Ia Regulation. (See pages 387-389 of the article)

It is argued that the Hague Convention’s system of ‘qualified’ or ‘partial’ mutual trust may permit anti-suit injunctions, actions for damages for breach of exclusive jurisdiction agreements and anti-enforcement injunctions where such remedies further the objective of the Convention. (See pages 394-402 of the article) The text of the Hague Convention and the Explanatory Report by Professors Trevor Hartley and Masato Dogauchi are not explicit on this issue. However, the procès-verbal of the Diplomatic Session of the Hague Convention reveal widespread support for the proposition that the formal ‘process’ should be differentiated from the desired ‘outcome’ when considering whether anti-suit injunctions are permitted under the Convention. Where anti-suit injunctions uphold choice of court agreements and thus help achieve the intended ‘outcome’ of the Convention, there was a consensus among the official delegates at the Diplomatic Session that the Convention did not limit or constrain national courts of Contracting States from granting the remedy. (See Minutes No 9 of the Second Commission Meeting of Monday 20 June 2005 (morning) in Proceedings of the Twentieth Session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (Permanent Bureau of the Conference, Intersentia 2010) 622, 623–24) Conversely, where the remedy impedes the sound operation of the Convention by effectively derailing proceedings in the chosen court, there was also a consensus of the official delegates at the meeting that the Convention will not permit national courts of the Contracting States to grant anti-suit injunctions.

However, intra-EU Hague Convention cases may arguably not permit remedies for breach of exclusive choice of court agreements as they may be deemed to be an infringement of the principle of mutual trust and the principle of effectiveness of EU law (effet utile) which animate the multilateral jurisdiction and judgments order of the Brussels Ia Regulation (see pages 403-405 of the article; C-159/02 Turner v Grovit [2004] ECR I-3565). If an aggrieved party does not commence proceedings in the chosen forum or commences such proceedings after the non-chosen court has rendered a decision on the validity of the choice of court agreement, the recognition and enforcement of that ruling highlights an interesting contrast between the Brussels Ia Regulation and the Hague Convention. It appears that the non-chosen court’s decision on the validity of the choice of court agreement is entitled to recognition and enforcement under the Brussels Ia Regulation. (See C-456/11 Gothaer Allgemeine Versicherung AG v Samskip GmbH EU:C:2012:719, [2013] QB 548) The Hague Convention does not similarly protect the ruling of a non-chosen court. In fact, only a judgment given by a court of a Contracting State designated in an exclusive choice of court agreement shall be recognised and enforced in other Contracting States. (See Article 8(1) of the Hague Convention) Therefore, the ruling of a non-chosen court is not entitled to recognition and enforcement under the Hague Convention’s system of ‘qualified’ or ‘partial’ mutual trust. This provides a ready explanation for the compatibility of anti-suit injunctions with the Hague Convention but does not proceed any further to transpose the same conclusion into the very different context of the Brussels Ia Regulation which prioritizes the principle of mutual trust.

The dynamics of the relationship between Article 31(2) of the Brussels Ia Regulation and Articles 5 and 6 of the Hague Convention is mapped in the article (at pages 405-408). In a case where the Hague Convention should apply rather than the Brussels Ia Regulation because one of the parties is resident in a non-EU Contracting State to the Convention even though the chosen court is in a Member State of the EU (See Article 26(6)(a) of the Hague Convention) one would expect Article 6 of the Convention to be applied by any non-chosen court in the EU. However, the fundamental nature of the Article 31(2) lis pendens mechanism under the Brussels Ia Regulation may warrant the pursuance of a different line of analysis. (See Case C-452/12 Nipponkoa Insurance Co (Europe) Ltd v Interzuid Transport BV EU:C:2013:858, [2014] I.L.Pr. 10, [36]; See also to similar effect, Case C-533/08 TNT Express Nederland BV v AXA Versicherung AG EU:C:2010:243, [2010] I.L.Pr. 35, [49]) It is argued that the Hartley–Dogauchi Report’s interpretative approach has much to commend it as it follows the path of least resistance by narrowly construing the right to sue in a non-chosen forum as an exception rather than the norm. The exceptional nature of the right to sue in the non-chosen forum under the Hague Convention can be effectively reconciled with Article 31(2) of the Brussels Ia Regulation. This will usually result in the stay of the proceedings in the non-chosen court as soon as the chosen court is seised. As a consequence, the incidence of parallel proceedings and irreconcilable judgments are curbed, which are significant objectives in their own right under the Brussels Ia Regulation. It is hoped that the yet to develop jurisprudence of the CJEU on the emergent Hague Convention and the Brussels Ia Regulation will offer definitive and authoritative answers to the issues discussed in the article.

The implications of Brexit on this topic are not yet fully clear. (See pages 409-410 of the article) The UK is a party to the Hague Choice of Court Agreements Convention as a Member State of the EU, the latter having approved the Convention for all its Member States apart from Denmark. The UK will do what is necessary to remain a party to the Convention after Brexit. In its recently published negotiating paper – only available after the article in the Journal of Private International Law was completed – the UK Government has explicitly stated that:

“It is our intention to continue to be a leading member in the Hague Conference and to participate in those Hague Conventions to which we are already a party and those which we currently participate in by virtue of our membership of the EU.” (See Providing a cross-border civil judicial cooperation framework (PDF) at para 22)

The UK will no doubt avoid any break in the Convention’s application. Brexit will almost certainly see the end of the application of the Brussels Ia Regulation in the UK. The reason being that its uniform interpretation is secured by the CJEU through the preliminary ruling system under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The UK is not willing to accept that jurisdiction post-Brexit (“Leaving the EU will therefore bring an end to the direct jurisdiction of the CJEU in the UK, because the CJEU derives its jurisdiction and authority from the EU Treaties.” (See Providing a cross-border civil judicial cooperation framework at para 20) So although the UK negotiators are asking for a bespoke deal with the EU to continue something like Brussels Ia (“The UK will therefore seek an agreement with the EU that allows for close and comprehensive cross-border civil judicial cooperation on a reciprocal basis, which reflects closely the substantive principles of cooperation under the current EU framework”: see Providing a cross-border civil judicial cooperation framework at para 19) it seems improbable that the EU will agree to such a bespoke deal just with the UK when the UK does not accept the CJEU preliminary ruling system. The EU may well say that the option for close partners of the EU in this field is the Lugano Convention. The UK Government has indicated that it would like to remain part of the Lugano Convention (see Providing a cross-border civil judicial cooperation framework at para 22). In doing so it would continue to mandate the UK courts to take account of the jurisprudence of the CJEU -when that court is interpreting Brussels Ia or the Lugano Convention – when UK courts are interpreting the Lugano Convention (see the opaque statement by the UK Government that “the UK and the EU will need to ensure future civil judicial cooperation takes into account regional legal arrangements, including the fact that the CJEU will remain the ultimate arbiter of EU law within the EU.” see Providing a cross-border civil judicial cooperation framework at para 20). However, unless the Lugano Convention is renegotiated it does not contain a good solution in relation to conflicts of jurisdiction for exclusive choice of court agreements because it has not been amended to reflect Article 31(2) of Brussels Ia and therefore still gives priority to the non-chosen court when it is seised first and the exclusively chosen court is seised second in accordance with the Gasser decision of the CJEU (see Case C-116/02 [2003] ECR I-14693). Renegotiation of the Lugano Convention is not even on the agenda at the moment although the Gasser problem may be discussed at the Experts’ Meeting pursuant to Article 5 Protocol 2 of the Lugano Convention on 16 and 17 October 2017 in Basel, Switzerland (Professor Beaumont is attending that meeting as an invited expert). Revision of the Lugano Convention would be a good thing, as would Norway and Switzerland becoming parties to the Hague Convention. It seems that at least until the Lugano Convention is revised and a means is found for the UK to be a party to it (difficult if the UK does not stay in EFTA), the likely outcome post-Brexit is that the regime applicable between the UK and the EU (apart from Denmark) in relation to exclusive choice of court agreements within the scope of the Hague Convention will be the Hague Convention. The UK will be able to grant anti-suit injunctions to uphold exclusive choice of court agreements in favour of the courts in the UK even when one of the parties has brought an action contrary to that agreement in an EU Member State. The EU Member States will apply Article 6 of the Hague Convention rather than Article 31(2) of the Brussels Ia Regulation when deciding whether to decline jurisdiction in favour of the chosen court(s) in the UK.

Whilst the Hague Convention only offers a comprehensive jurisdictional regime for cases involving exclusive choice of court agreements, it does give substantial protection to the jurisdiction of UK courts designated in such an agreement which will be respected in the rest of the EU regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. Post-Brexit the recognition and enforcement regime for judgments not falling within the scope of the Hague Choice of Court Agreements Convention could be the new Hague Judgments Convention currently being negotiated in The Hague (see Working Paper No. 2016/3- Respecting Reverse Subsidiarity as an excellent strategy for the European Union at The Hague Conference on Private International Law – reflections in the context of the Judgments Project? by Paul Beaumont). Professor Beaumont will continue to be a part of the EU Negotiating team for that Convention at the Special Commission in the Hague from 13-17 November 2017. It is to be welcomed that the UK Government has affirmed its commitment to an internationalist and not just a regional approach to civil judicial co-operation:

“The UK is committed to increasing international civil judicial cooperation with third parties through our active participation in the Hague Conference on Private International Law and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law… We will continue to be an active and supportive member of these bodies, as we are clear on the value of international and intergovernmental cooperation in this area.” See Providing a cross-border civil judicial cooperation framework at para 21.

One good thing that could come from Brexit is the powerful combination of the EU and the UK both adopting a truly internationalist perspective in the Hague Conference on Private International Law in order to genuinely enhance civil judicial co-operation throughout the world. The UK can be one of the leaders of the common law world while using its decades of experience of European co-operation to help build bridges to the civil law countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Following the decision of 52% of the UK electorate to exit the European Union (EU) on 23 June 2016, Prime Minister Theresa May has been steadfast in her belief that the power to initiate the UK’s exit from the EU lay with the Government under the ‘royal prerogative’ and not with Parliament. On Thursday 3 November 2016, however, the High Court of Justice in England gave its highly anticipated judgment in the Brexit Case (R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2016] EWHC 2768 (Admin)), ruling that the UK Government must seek parliamentary approval before exiting the EU. This blog post will briefly outline the reasoning of the High Court in reaching its decision, as well as its implications and potential consequences.

Justiciability and the Irrevocability of Article 50

Before considering the reasoning of the High Court, two points must be stressed.

Firstly, all parties to the case, including the Government, accepted that the matter before the Court was entirely justiciable. In other words, that it concerned a legal matter that the courts are best placed to decide.

Secondly, the case proceeded on the basis that Article 50 – the legal mechanism by which a Member State may formally leave the EU – once triggered, could not be revoked. In other words, the UK will be unable to change its mind and stop Brexit once notice has been given under the provision. Although the accuracy of this interpretation has been questioned on this blog, it must be stressed that the Court did not have to make a ruling on this matter as both parties were in agreement that Article 50 was irrevocable.

The High Court’s Reasoning

The central question before the Court was whether the UK Government can use the royal prerogative to give notice of the UK’s intention to exit the EU under Article 50 as it claimed. The royal prerogative is the body of executive powers held by the Monarch but which is now mostly exercised in practice by Government Ministers.

The High Court rejected the Government’s argument, deciding that the royal prerogative could not be used without parliamentary approval. According to the Court, triggering Article 50 without Parliament’s approval would have the effect of removing the rights currently enjoyed by UK citizens by virtue of the UK’s membership of the EU both at home and abroad. Examples include workers’ rights, freedom of movement across the other EU Member States, and the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament. When the UK joined the EU in 1973, Parliament first had to pass the European Communities Act 1972, which gave domestic effect to EU law. As a result, EU law became part of UK law, and citizens could thereafter bring actions for breach of EU law, including their EU rights, in the domestic courts. The Court decided that, in passing the 1972 Act, Parliament did not intend to allow the UK Government to take away these rights unilaterally. To do otherwise would be to change the domestic law of the UK as enacted by Parliament, and only Parliament had the power to do so because it was legally sovereign.

The Court’s decision therefore makes it clear that the Prime Minister now needs Parliament’s consent before Article 50 can be triggered. The implication of the decision is that this approval must take the form of primary legislation, thus making a one-off vote in the House of Commons insufficient. Unsurprisingly, the decision of the High Court, and the necessity for legislation, could have potentially far reaching consequences.

The Future of Brexit

The High Court’s decision represents a serious setback for the UK Government, and the Prime Minister is already under considerable pressure to concede and comply with the decision. Although the Prime Minister had said that she would trigger Article 50 in March 2017, this looks to be in doubt should she be compelled to put the matter before Parliament for legislative approval. Whilst this may only result in a delay in the triggering of Article 50, Parliament could also decide to block the UK’s exit from the EU altogether. Whether or not Parliament would do so, however, is unclear. Although not legally required to follow the referendum result, political forces both within and outwith Parliament may compel members to go ahead with Brexit, albeit perhaps on terms different from what the current Government wants.

Even if the elected House of Commons consents to any Bill authorising the triggering Article 50, however, Theresa May will likely face strong opposition from the unelected House of Lords. Because leaving the EU was not a manifesto commitment of Theresa May’s newly-formed Government, the Salisbury Convention will not be engaged, and the Lords will not be compelled constitutionally to approve the legislation as a result. (It will be recalled that conventions are very important to the House of Lords, as I explored in a post on this blog and a related post for the UK Constitutional Law Association.) This may necessitate, therefore, the use of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 to ensure the Bill’s passage through Parliament, which will further delay Brexit.

The UK Supreme Court

Whether or not Parliament will ever be given a say, however, is still far from settled, as the UK Government have said that they will appeal the decision to the UK Supreme Court in the hope that it will be overturned. The case is expected to be heard in December before a panel of 11 Justices for the very first time in history. A judgment is expected sometime in the New Year. Although the case was heard in England and concerned a matter of English Law, Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government may formally intervene in the legal proceedings. The Welsh Counsel General has indicated his intention to apply to intervene, in accordance with the Government of Wales Act 2006. Withdrawal from the EU will unquestionably impact upon the UK’s devolutionary settlement, and the UK Supreme Court has jurisdiction to decide devolutionary matters.

An Early General Election

Although there is speculation in the media that the Prime Minister could call an early General Election to try and receive a mandate from the public on pursuing her vision of Brexit, it must be stressed that she does not in fact have the power to do so. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 abolished the prerogative power of the Crown, exercised by the Prime Minister, to call a general election, and gave that power to the House of Commons. In order to have an election before 2020, therefore, Theresa May must lose a vote of no confidence, or two-thirds of the Commons must agree to call one. Should the Government lose their appeal at the UK Supreme Court, a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister is possible given the Conservative party’s narrow majority in the House of Commons.

What next?

That is a good question. As noted by my colleague Dr. Justin Borg-Barthet, the one thing we can be sure of is we still cannot be quite sure what Brexit means.

A hard Brexit might have severe implications for the NHS, whereas a soft BREXIT may only cause some changes in the British system.","nhs, healthcare, disease, british, uk, cure, eu, brexit, impact, uks, health, system","The National Health Service (NHS) is one of the UK’s most important institutions. Since its establishment in 1948, it provides healthcare to all citizens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, regardless of their economic status. It is also one of the country’s largest employers, employing thousands of medical and non-medical staff members. Given its long history and multiple functions, the NHS is governed by a range of laws. As a British mechanism, it is primarily subject to the UK’s domestic rules, as these apply in England, Scotland, N. Ireland, and Wales. At the same time, the NHS is regulated by the applicable laws of the European Union (EU).

On 29 March 2017, and following a national referendum of 23 June 2016, the UK government triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty (http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html) to initiate the country’s departure from the EU. The so-called ‘Brexit’ is expected to affect the legal, economic, social, and political institutions of the UK, including its healthcare system. For the campaigners in favour of Brexit, the prospective detachment from the EU was portrayed as saving the UK £350 million per week, which could be reinvested in the NHS. But as time passes, this argument fades away.

An inquiry was commenced by the House of Commons Health Committee about that issue, but was abruptly disrupted by the general election of June 2017. In its report, the Committee pointed out six areas which are likely to be affected by Brexit: health and social care workforce; reciprocal healthcare coverage and cross-border healthcare; medicines, products medical devices, clinical trials and wider health research; public health, including environmental protections and communicable diseases; resources, including EU agencies, funding programmes, networks and health in overseas aid; and market functioning and trade agreements. Because of its disruption by the 2017 election, the Committee has managed to cover only the first two areas from the above list. The present article will share the Committee’s views on the examined topics and shed some light on the areas which remain unaddressed.

Which Areas of UK’s Healthcare System will be Affected by Brexit?

Health and Social Care Workforce

One of the immediate effects of Brexit will be on the workforce of the health and social care sector. Today, over 60,000 Europeans are employed by the NHS and another 90,000 work in adult social care. To this day, those workers have been treated as nationals in terms of their immigration status and conditions of employment. However, the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will change that, for both the current and the future staff of the British healthcare system. A new immigration and professional qualification regime will need to be adopted post-Brexit, to regulate the entrance, residency, and employment of EU medical and social care workers in the UK. The impact of Brexit on this domain is already visible. In March 2017, a 92% drop was reported in the number of EU nurses registering to the NHS, which has been linked to the failure of the British government to provide EU workers with security about their future. A decline, although much lesser, has also been observed after the Brexit referendum in the applications of EU licensed doctors to the NHS. Again, the underlying uncertainty of workers about their immigration and employment conditions has been identified as the main reason for this trend.

Reciprocal Healthcare Coverage and Cross-border Healthcare

Apart from working rights across the EU, freedom of movement allows EU visitors who possess a European Health Insurance Card to use the health care services of the NHS. Conversely, the great number of UK travellers or pensioners who reside to European countries can currently receive free or low-cost health services outside the UK. This reciprocal healthcare coverage will end once the UK exits the EU. Although the UK might benefit from the fact that it will no longer provide health services to non-UK nationals, it will need to cover the health expenses of the UK nationals (and particularly pensioners) who were previously insured by EU countries. The number of people who will need to be covered by the NHS post-Brexit will be much greater than before. According to reports, about 145,000 UK pensioners rely on EU health services at the moment, whereas only 4,000 EU pensioners are registered to the NHS. Considering the number and the age of those people, it is expected that the British healthcare budget will be significantly affected after Brexit.

Medicines, Products, and Devices

The EU regulates the licensing and supply across its members of all kinds of health products -from pharmaceuticals and medical devices, to substances of human origin, like blood and organs. The competent authority for this work is the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which, until recently, was based in London and is now relocated to Amsterdam. It is not yet certain whether the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will also terminate the country’s participation in the above licensing mechanism. But if it does, the UK will no longer be able to distribute its medical products across the EU at the current levels of high speed and low cost. Of course, the UK has its own medical authority, called the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. However, this organisation deals exclusively with the supply of medicines at national, rather than at cross-border level. If the UK wishes to keep using medical products from the EU or supply the community with its own ones, it will need to make a special arrangement with the EMA.

Public Health

EU law has played an important role in regulating a spectrum of health issues which concern its member States. Within the years, it has developed a comprehensive and innovative legal framework, controlling: the consumption of foods and products which are responsible for diseases like obesity and diabetes; the distribution of tobacco and alcohol; and the control of toxic emissions from cars and industries which could be harmful to people’s health. Also, unlike any other system, the European community has shown outstanding competence to respond to cross-border health threats, like Ebola, in a co-ordinated and effective manner. By leaving the EU, the UK will no longer adhere to the community’s health agenda and the actions taken for the improvement of the EU citizens’ lives. That is expected to have an impact on the lives of millions of British citizens, especially those dealing with long-term and serious health conditions. Likewise, the UK’s departure from the EU law will mean that the decisions of the EU courts on matters of healthcare will no longer bind the UK and its regulatory bodies. This might be detrimental to any British citizens, who will seek to protect their rights in the future against national healthcare service providers.

Resources

The EU is a significant source of funding. Initiatives, like the Horizon 2020 programme, and bodies, like the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund provide EU members with the necessary means to conduct research and make significant discoveries in the field of healthcare and medicine. Arguably, the UK’s expenditure towards the EU funds will cease, which may be viewed as a boost to the national budget. However, it is estimated that the total saving from those costs will be only 0.31% of the national income. By contrast, the amounts of funding that the UK will miss post-BREXIT are much greater. Since 2001, the EU Investment Bank has provided over €3.5 billion to the NHS. Also, every year, a number of scholarships are awarded to British universities and institutions for the conduct of postgraduate studies or conferences on sciences, like medicine. The UK’s departure from the EU will mean that these funds need to be covered by domestic sources. Apart from funding, the current freedom of movement allows EU scientists to visit the UK for the purposes of their research and vice versa, without visa or other restrictions. Withdrawal from this network would deprive the UK from the above benefits, and have a negative impact on the quality of its academic and research institutions on the area of health studies. Concerned about this outcome, members of the academic community of the UK have already voiced their opposition to Brexit. But only time will tell whether these fears will eventually come true or not.

Market Functioning and Trade Agreements

Finally, Brexit will have a market and trade impact. The driving force behind the birth of the EU was the creation of a single market among its members, which would allow the conduct of economic and trade activities without severe tax or regulatory barriers. The above benefits extend to the provision of healthcare services within the EU. They contribute to lower transaction costs between the member States, and which in turn can contribute to more effective patient care. A shift in the existing framework may entail the imposition of quotas, tariffs and other measures that would affect the flow of goods and services between the single market and the UK. This will affect the management of British hospitals and NHS clinics, the procurement of medical supplies, and eventually, the provision of services to patients.

How Intense will the Impact of Brexit be on the UK’s Healthcare System?

The areas of the UK’s healthcare which are likely to be affected by Brexit are numerous and diverse. But whether this impact will be minimal, substantive, or devastating for the NHS has yet to be measured. This value will primarily rely on the type of Brexit and the deal which the UK and the EU make within the following years. Insofar as negotiations are still in progress, one can only estimate the magnitude of the potential outcomes, rather than make accurate predictions. But broadly speaking, this impact will vary in the scenarios of a ‘soft’ and a ‘hard’ Brexit.

Soft Brexit

In general, a ‘soft Brexit’ would mean that the UK maintains a relationship with the EU and has an interaction with the single market, although not under the same conditions as before Brexit. This situation resembles closely the relationship of Norway and Lichtenstein with the EU. Certain limitations and restrictions will apply in terms of medicine trade, conduct of healthcare research, and movement for the purposes of work or treatment at the NHS. However, it is likely that the rights of EU nationals who already reside or work in the UK will be secured from a sudden discharge. Still, it is up to the negotiating parties to decide as to how these rights will keep operating in the future and whether they will be affected in the long run by UK’s withdrawal from the EU laws and courts of justice. Likewise, the UK will cease to be part of the law-making process in the European Parliament. This may have an impact on the health benefits that many of its nationals have acquired within the EU.

Hard Brexit

By contrast, a ‘hard Brexit’ would mean that the UK abandons the single market and maintains full control of its borders with regards to circulation of people, goods, and capital. This would be similar to the relationship that the EU has with any third countries which are not its members. In this scenario, the conduct of any transactions between the UK and the single market in the context of healthcare will be subject to mutual tariffs, quotas and other regulatory and tax restrictions. Likewise, the domicile of EU nationals who already work or study in the UK and vice versa, and the entry of newcomers in the future will be subject to immigration requirements, like the possession of a visa or green card. Of course, it is up to the two sides to enter a trade deal, like that between the EU and Canada. Although this might fall outside the scope of a hard Brexit, it would ease many restrictions in the commercial and scientific collaboration between the UK and the EU. It is also possible that the UK enters a deal with the USA or with Asian countries for the exchange of low-cost and effective healthcare services. But this may give rise to a new kind of dependency of the UK on a foreign system, and such a relationship seems to have been a contributing factor towards Brexit in the first place.

Final Thoughts

The UK has been an EU member since 1973. 43 years later, the country decided to withdraw membership and follow its own course. The decision of a sovereign State to leave the EU family must be fairly respected. But at the same time, the consequences of this act cannot be overlooked. There is no doubt that Brexit is one of the most important legal events in modern British history. The impact of such major legal reform will stretch across various sectors, including the UK’s healthcare system. Although a national body, the NHS has been heavily governed by the regulatory framework and the authoritative mechanisms of the EU.

The early studies support that the impact of Brexit on the NHS will be negative. Yet, the conclusion as to how post-Brexit NHS may be inferior to pre-Brexit NHS will rely heavily on two factors. The first is the type of Brexit that will be agreed. A hard Brexit might have severe implications for the NHS, whereas a soft BREXIT may only cause some changes in the British system. The second factor is the passing of time. Until the NHS ‘stands on its own feet’ and operates outside the EU system, one can only make assumptions about its survival. It is hoped that a feasible and legally viable solution will be reached, so that the lives of those relying on the NHS will not be dramatically affected.

Editor’s note: the initial title of this blog was “What is sufficient to constitute an Article 50 notification to leave the EU?” It was edited on 28 June 2016 to change “notification” to “decision”.","sufficient, notification, constitute, 50, eu, article, constitutional, decision, parliament, act, effect, leave","The UK stands on edge of the momentous decision to leave the EU. It is therefore vital that the true meaning of Article 50 is understood. In particular it is my contention that this cannot be triggered by the decision of the PM or cabinet but only by Act of Parliament.

Article 50 begins by noting:

Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.

There are two essential elements here. Firstly, only the State which wishes to leave may make such a decision. Secondly, authority to make such a decision must be “in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.” So this in turn leads us to consider the requirements of the British Constitution. (Article 50 then goes on to say “A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention.” The issue of notification is a matter not considered in detail here.)

In Britain it is Parliament which is sovereign, not the Prime Minister or even the whole Cabinet. The UK entered the EU by means of the European Communities Act 1972. The repeal of an Act of Parliament may only be done by a subsequent Act of Parliament to that effect. As the effect of an Article 50 notification is to trigger a two year timeline at the end of which that even UK would automatically cease to be an EU Member State that would be to nullify the effect of the 1972 Act as a matter of EU law. But as a matter of British law a statute may only be repealed by another statute. It therefore follows as a matter of British law that to have sufficient authority a Prime Minister would need that authority of an Act of Parliament to that effect giving him the authority to make an Article 50 notification and prospectively repealing the 1972 Act with effect from two years of making the notification.

To be clear, I do not think the authority of the House of Commons alone would suffice. What is needed is a statute passed by both Houses of Parliament (Lords and Commons) plus subsequent Royal Assent. There is of course the not insignificant issue of the pro Leave decision in the referendum of 23 June, but whilst that is politically very significant it is not legally enough. To comply with the EU legal requirement of a request “in accordance with its own constitutional requirements” a Prime Minster needs to get an Act through both Houses. As both Commons and Lords contain large Remain majorities this may prove challenging for any Prime Minster to obtain.

There is no doubt that a refusal by Parliament to give effect to the decision of a referendum would cause huge public outcry, even a constitutional crisis, but that crisis would be political not legal. There is already some evident of “buyer’s remorse” and that many Leave voters regret their decision or that many who abstained regret abstaining. There are two possible ways to square the political circle of a Remain Parliament defying the “will of the people” expressed in the recent referendum.

The first, and easiest, would be for Parliament to pass an Act authorising an Article 50 notification and repeal of the 1972 Act but to make the coming into effect of that Act conditional on it being approved by a post-legislative referendum. There is a strong precedent for such a provision in the Scotland Act 1978. Indeed some might even go so far as to want to a 40% of the electorate rule as well as was found in the 1978 Act, although I personally think that would be going to far.

The second way to establish if it really is the “settled will of the British people” to leave the EU would be to hold a General Election (subject to the operation of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011) on the express issue of EU membership with every candidate declaring where they stand on the issue of EU membership. This might even result in candidates standing as “Labour/Conservative/LibDem Leave/Remain” candidates. If a pro Leave majority was returned then obviously such a Commons would happily pass an “Article 50 Act” and the Lords would be obliged to defer to the Commons on application of that Salisbury Principles.

There is also the argument that the consent of the devolved assemblies is needed, but this is a constitutional novelty. (This argument has not attracted the unflinching support of constitutional lawyers, or indeed a prominent Scottish National Party politician.) The strength of the argument I am advancing is that it rests on the classical Diceyan understanding of the British Constitution.

The High Court decision in Miller (the ‘Brexit case’) was essentially a public law case. The judgment (PDF) addresses the question of whether the royal prerogative can be exercised to repeal vested statutory rights. As is well known, the Court found in the negative. In the Court’s view, therefore, notice of the UK’s intention to withdraw from the European Union requires parliamentary consent.

But the judgment turns on a question of EU law, namely whether revocation of notice of intention to withdraw from the EU is possible. Here too the Court found in the negative. Both the claimants and government were of the view that once notice is given under Article 50 TEU (http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/traty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html), that notice is irrevocable. In other words, once the UK notifies the European Council that it wishes to withdraw, the UK cannot change its mind and withdraw notification. Rights derived from the European Communities Act 1972 will be repealed whether Parliament consents or otherwise.

But is the Court correct in its findings regarding Article 50 TEU? If it is not, its public law findings rest on a false premise and are therefore potentially unfounded.

Article 50 TEU provides as follows:

1) Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.

2) A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.

3) The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period.

4) For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the withdrawing Member State shall not participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it.

A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

5) If a State which has withdrawn from the Union asks to rejoin, its request shall be subject to the procedure referred to in Article 49.

There is nothing in that article which addresses the question of a change of mind (or heart, as the case may be). Once Article 50 is invoked, it seems, the process of withdrawal is inexorable.

Yeah but

The High court was correct in its findings, or so it appears at first blush. Surely if the Member States wished the Treaty to provide for revocation of notice under Article 50, they would have done so. What is more, if the withdrawing Member State were at liberty unilaterally to revoke its notification of withdrawal from the Union, this would have the practical effect of enabling that State unilaterally to extend the two-year period for withdrawal. It could revoke notice and start the two-year period afresh at a later date of its own choosing. Surely, then, unilateral revocation of notice is not allowed.

But it does not necessarily follow that the revocation of notice is impossible. The Member States are at liberty, should they agree unanimously, to extend the two-year period. Art 50(3) does not establish a ceiling for the extension of that period. In the absence of any such limits, it follows that the Member States may extend the period indefinitely. Effectively, they can agree unanimously to suspend the withdrawal of the Member State. It would be absurd in such circumstances to argue that the Member States could not formalise an informal suspension of notice to withdraw from the Union.

No but

It appears, therefore, that the High Court was not entirely correct in its findings. The basic premise that Article 50 is irrevocable is not unimpeachable. But it does not follow that the rest of the Court’s reasoning is wrong. The public law reasoning concerns the potential usurpation by government of Parliament’s sovereign right to retain or repeal rights conferred by the European Communities Act 1972. The power to revoke notification under Article 50 does not reside in the sovereign Parliament of the United Kingdom. Instead it resides with every other Member State of the Union. Malta, for the sake of the argument, could choose whether rights conferred on British citizens by the European Communities Act 1972 are to be repealed.

The High Court’s findings are therefore unaffected by the potential flaw in its (and the parties’) reasoning. If the Court is correct in its reasoning as to the public law question, the judgment remains sound notwithstanding the potential flaw in the interpretation of Art 50 TEU. Any notification by government of the UK’s intention to withdraw from the European Union divests Parliament of its right to retain or repeal rights conferred by the European Communities Act 1972.

But but

Prof Steve Peers argues, persuasively it is submitted, that the question of revocability of Article 50 is not settled. Indeed, contrary to the High Court’s ruling and to my own reasoning above, Lord Kerr, the author of Article 50, argues that unilateral revocation of notice is possible. Where there is a question as to the interpretation of EU law, Article 267 TFEU requires a supreme court of a Member State (and the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom still plays that role) to seek interpretative guidance from the Court of Justice of the European Union. If the Supreme Court fails to refer the question, the United Kingdom could be liable to damages under the Kobler doctrine.

There could yet, therefore, be many twists in the tale of Brexit. All that is certain at this juncture, is that we cannot be quite certain of the meaning of Brexit (means Brexit).

Bill Kidd MSP called out the UK Government’s use of Brexit to cover up additional cuts to income penalising mixed-aged pensioner couples. Initially announced in the 14th January week of Brexit votes, following on from the spectacle leading up to Christmas, the UK Government sneaked in a significant cut to pensioner’s income amidst the clamour and fanfare of Brexit headlines. The change means that from the 15th May new pensioners with younger partners (under the age of 65) will no longer be able to apply for Pensioner’s Credit. Instead, they will have to apply for Universal Credit. Affected households will each loose up to £7,320 per year until their partner reaches the age of 65. Last week SPICe- an independent parliamentary research centre- found that 10% of Scottish pensioner households claiming pensioner credit are likely to be affected by the change. 15,000 couples across the UK are expected to be hit by this change in this year alone.Bill Kidd MSP has emphasized, “Food bank use is on the rise and the Tories have finally admitted that their crippling scheme of Universal Credit is to blame. This system is an unacceptable and cruel prioritisation of the richest above the poorest. Using Brexit to sneak in this additional universal credit cut hits another low point for the Tories. I, along with my SNP colleagues here in the Scottish Parliament and in Westminster, will not stop speaking out for our constituents. We want a system which is fair and does not penalise the poorest in Scotland.” Universal Credit was rolled out in into the Anniesland constituency area on 5th December 2018.

On Tuesday [27 February], Bill Kidd MSP once again brought Universal Credit to the attention of the Scottish Parliament by asking Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People for the Scottish Government’s response to this unfair change. In response, the Cabinet Secretary Shirley Anne Somerville noted that she has written to the UK Government to raise serious concerns about this and went on to say: “The families that are affected will find themselves much worse off than they would have anticipated. Those who are no longer entitled to claim Pensioner’s Credit will be forced to claim Universal Credit, which is of course much less generous for couples. We know already that Universal Credit is causing problems… Universal Credit’s introduction has led to an increase in rent arrears and forced people into hardship. That is something which the Secretary of State has admitted in the last couple of weeks.”

The average age gap between couples is 2.6 years. The period a pensioner will have to wait until their younger partner reaches pensioner age (which will increase to 66 for both men and women in 2020) means that some pensioners could be £19,000 worse off due to this change.

Universal Credit has been widely criticized. From the two-child limit and the rape clause to the 12- week delays in receiving a first payment, charities and politicians across the country have been consistently calling for a halt to the new programme. UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty, Philip Alston, toured the UK last October. He found fundamental flaws in the system that need to be addressed. In a statement he said: “many aspects of the design and rollout of the programme [Universal Credit] have suggested that the DWP is more concerned with making economic savings and sending messages about lifestyles than responding to the multiple needs of those living with a disability, job loss, housing insecurity, illness and the demands of parenting... An increasing body of research makes clear that there are far too many instances in which Universal Credit is being implemented in ways that negatively impact many claimants' mental health, finances, and work prospects.” Emphasizing that the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy, containing many areas of immense wealth, Alston continued, “it seems patently unjust and contrary to British values that so many people are living in poverty.”

14 million people, a fifth of the population, live in poverty in the UK."

Central Belt Shuffler, away from home turf, joined colleagues in solidarity at another university outside the students’ union.

The day before, I’d been travelling to my temporary home in the Midlands. The Sunday afternoon train was packed with people returning from half-term holidays, shopping in the big city, and heading onwards to the airport at the end of the route. Large suitcases and bags stuffed with new purchases were blocking the aisles, and several people were standing. Families and friends were separated, picking single seats where they could.

When the overcrowding on the train eased a little, a quiet, turbaned train guard checked our tickets. Then, from the other end of the carriage, the food and drinks trolley started to make its way, pushed by a dreadlocked man. He made it through to the vestibule area, which was still blocked by scattered suitcases, mine included. In a cheerful manner, he started to rearrange people’s bags to make more room, lifting smaller bags to the overhead racks, and fitting the larger ones into the spaces at the end of the carriage.

He talked good-naturedly while he did so, his intonation inflected by his Caribbean accent. He came to talk to our few seats, making all the passengers laugh with his explanation of how stacking luggage wasn’t his job, but he needed to make the passageways clear so he could sell from the trolley. He explained his father had always told him to do a decent day’s work. His dad had been a farmer, and he would also work as a farmer, and a builder, before he came over to the UK from Montserrat. He’d watch his goats, and plant during January to April: dasheen, sweet potato, blue peas, cucumber. His father would grow enough for him and his family, to give some to neighbours, to sell some. He couldn’t farm in the UK, and had tried building work for a while, but his hands couldn’t take the cold. So he was working on the trains. He was heading home to Montserrat for a couple of weeks’ holiday soon. He was looking forward to it.

As we approached the next stop, a larger city where lots of people got up to leave, he asked everyone to sit back down again to make way for the train guard as he came through to open the doors. The guard smiled wryly as he went past. Our trolley man sang us a bit of Bob Marley.

As we left the train, each passenger got a hand down with their bags, including my very heavy suitcase.

I smiled at him as I left the train, and thanked just one more of the individuals who come to make their homes here, and thereby enrich our lives, help us out, share their stories, and spread the love."

“People are discussing Brexit as an idea,” she says. “They forget that it’s people’s lives. It’s children with nothing on their plates, families going to bed at night cold because they can’t afford the heating. I saw enough of it after the ‘Craig shut. We’re just starting to recover. I don’t want to see that again. “Why would we want to put further risk and uncertainty into our lives by coming out of the UK? Do you want to see two, three generations of people here with no work? Because that’s what happened here [when Ravenscraig closed].” But you can feel a different mood among younger people. I arranged to meet a local band rehearsing at the Motherwell Business Centre. The Banter Thiefs are four young men who were at school together and who’ve been playing gigs around Scotland and elsewhere in Europe for years. They are all strongly for an independent Scotland - and they all voted Remain.

“For me the Brexit vote was about immigration,” Derek the bass player tells me. “Scotland is still a place of low immigration compared to places like London, but I don’t think Scotland scaremongers about immigration in the same way as in other places. We are a welcoming country. Scotland needs immigrants. It’s got an ageing population. We need people to come and work here and study here. We don’t want policies based on fear.” The others nod their agreement. “I think Brexit strengthens the case for independence. Am I more European or more British? Definitely more European.” I ask Derek whether he supported a second referendum, a People’s Vote. His answer is more concerned with the precedent it would set for the next independence referendum than it was with overturning Brexit. “I think supporting a People’s Vote is a mistake for the SNP,” he says. “It could come back to bite them. If we vote for independence in the future and the negotiations go badly then people might say after six months or two years - we need to vote again. And we could lose it then. I think that’s really detrimental.” On a building site earlier that day I had fallen into conversation with a tiler, working on a bathroom in a new house. I mentioned that I was going to see the Banter Thiefs. “Oh yeah,” he says. “Very pro-independence.”

Chris Roarty

Chris Roarty is a 23-year-old Labour activist. “Brexit has reinforced my belief that we should stay here in the UK. It’s a huge wake-up call on the risk and uncertainty of leaving,” he says Although the SNP campaigned to remain, Chris sees a parallel between its 2014 independence plan, and Brexit. “I think the Leave campaign and the independence campaign, when they were presented with facts on the economy, just said, ‘Oh that’s scaremongering’. But we’re seeing now that negotiations to leave a union can be really difficult. I don’t think we should be risking that again by breaking away from the UK. We can’t go into the unknown. There’s a huge economic risk. We should be opening doors not closing them.”

Scottish independence supporter, Glasgow, March 2019

Many in the SNP assumed that Brexit would lead to spike in support for independence. It hasn’t happened; at least not yet. Why not? When you glance at that solid block of Remain yellow on the map of Scotland it’s easy to overlook the fact that a million people in Scotland voted to leave the EU - 38% of those who voted. Of the 45% who voted for independence, as many as one in three supported leaving the EU. Anecdotally, one senior SNP official I spoke to conceded that while many people had moved from No to Yes on independence, there had been movement in the opposite direction too, among people who voted yes in 2014 but don’t want to be taken back into the EU by a future independent Scotland. There’s also been a revival of Tory fortunes in Scotland. For a generation, the Conservatives had appeared moribund. But after the election of Ruth Davidson as leader, the party repositioned itself. At the 2017 election, Conservatives in Scotland took the decision not to campaign on the same message as their counterparts in England. There wasn’t much talk in Scotland of “strong and stable government with Theresa May”. Instead, Davidson’s party campaigned on opposition to a second independence referendum, which Nicola Sturgeon had said was now inevitable. The Tories therefore offered themselves to the electorate as the party most robustly committed to defending the Union. It worked. Even North Lanarkshire Council, which includes Motherwell, has Tory councillors. Their leader is Meghan Gallacher. I ask her, too, whether she thought Brexit made independence more or less likely. She says it wouldn’t have any effect.

Amid the meaningful votes of recent days - the ones that turned out to have a different meaning in translation - we got an insight into the trading posture the UK Government intends to take.

This came in the long-awaited announcement on tariffs if there's no deal on Brexit. No doubt this was partly to alarm Tory and DUP MPs into backing the Prime Minister's deal. The intention is not to introduce the tariffs, but to be willing to do so in the event of no deal, at least for 12 months.

However, it also forced ministers into making choices on the direction of travel for tariffs, and indicating some of the dilemmas yet to be faced.

There were two big elements. One was to say that the international boundary in Ireland is to allow goods trade without barriers. The only checks, though not at the border, would be for some animal and food exports. That requires a sort of honesty box for those shifting goods across the EU frontier.

The other is to cut tariffs on most incoming goods to zero. That much appeals to the free marketeers among Brexiteers. More pragmatically, it is intended to avoid a surge in inflation due to tariffs adding to importers' costs.

The PM might have recalled that, when Britain joined the Common Market in 1973 and stayed in after the referendum of 1975, there was on both occasions a degree of cross-party co-operation, pursued by the leaders of the day.

She might have said at the start: ""This Parliament voted to hold a referendum. This Parliament voted to trigger Article 50. It is now incumbent upon this Parliament - this whole Parliament - to work to deliver the verdict of the people. I appeal to all parties to work with me in this endeavour.""

Then there is the third fundamental miscalculation, made by Theresa May's predecessor. David Cameron misread the mood of the British people when he called the referendum in the first place.

He did so to quell disquiet in Conservative ranks, assailed as they were by UKIP. He did so, consequently, for partisan reasons. He fully expected to win the referendum.

He missed the mood in England, outside London. A mood of disquiet after the economic slump of 2008. A mood of powerlessness. A growing concern about immigration. A sense that no-one was listening. A feeling that England's interests were being ignored.

Oranges and lemons."

The speeches were eerily familiar. The arguments repetitive.

And the prospect of a government defeat still in the air, especially as the DUP and the more zealous Tory Brexiteers say they remain unconvinced. Defeat, one presumes, by a lower margin than last time out, when the majority was 230 against the Treasury bench.

The one exception to this sense of Groundhog Day was Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, who acted as warm-up act to the PM. He said that his legal advice had changed as a result of the last ditch talks. There were ""materially new legal obligations"" upon the EU, most notably from the tight timetable now placed upon the future trade negotiations.

It was, as ever from the attorney general, a performance suffused with bravado. But he could not, he would not, seek to obfuscate entirely the point that his fundamental advice remained, substantially, unchanged.

The UK could not unilaterally abandon the Northern Ireland backstop in any and all circumstances. Yes, there were now more grounds available for suspending the backstop, based upon an accusation of bad faith against the EU. That could now be tested against the timetable.

But the UK could not - without agreement - withdraw from the backstop, unless key and exceptional circumstances arose.

Mr Cox however concluded - in a big concession for a QC - that the law was not everything. There were legal risks associated with everything - and one could take practical steps to remedy them.

This was, ultimately, a political decision. On all sides, MPs thanked him. They praised his sagacity. They praised his integrity.

And they reached for their various views on that political choice. As I write, it is not looking good for the prime minister and her endeavours to win support for her deal."

As a Scottish Conservative, I believe that the will of the people, as expressed in both referendums, must be respected, and that is why I support the UK Government’s policy of leaving the European Union as one United Kingdom.

Likewise, I believe that there must be no second referendum on independence, and no second referendum on Brexit. The people have made their views clear on both issues, and it is the UK Government’s duty to carry out their instructions.

For Scotland, and for the United Kingdom as a whole, Brexit will pose both challenges and opportunities, and the UK Government is seeking a Brexit deal that will allow us to deal with those challenges while making the most of those opportunities. This involves maintaining free and frictionless trade with the EU, and participating in EU schemes where it is mutually beneficial to both sides; and it also involves giving the UK the freedom to forge its own trade deals, and the ability to diverge from the EU where it does something that is not right for this country or our economy.

The UK Government is also working to provide businesses and individuals with as much certainty as possible about the Brexit process. This includes an implementation period after exit day, allowing people time to prepare for the new arrangements, and legislation like the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, which ensures that there is continuity in our laws immediately after Brexit.

In Scotland, my primary focus is preserving the internal market of the United Kingdom. 61% of Scotland’s trade goes to the rest of the UK, almost four times as much as goes to the EU, and so it is vital that we leave the EU as one United Kingdom, without any discrepancies emerging that make it more difficult for Scottish businesses to trade in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland.

Brexit will mean many powers currently held in Brussels, but relevant to devolved issues like agriculture, being devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The UK Government has been negotiating with the devolved administrations over how best to do this – all sides agree that while most of these powers should go straight to the devolved administrations, there will also need to be some common UK-wide frameworks to ensure that the UK internal market is preserved.

Recently, the UK and Welsh Governments came to an agreement on this, with the vast majority of devolved powers automatically going from the EU to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The EU (Withdrawal) Bill has been amended to reflect this deal. The Scottish Government has not yet agreed to this deal, but the UK Government’s door remains open, and I hope they come on board."

A deal will come back to Parliament by Tuesday the 12th of March for a vote and I hope Parliament will decide to support it, as I believe that is the best way to avoid a no deal scenario. However, if that vote is rejected by Parliament, a clear process has been set out that guarantees Parliament gets a vote on whether it wants to take no deal off the table. If that is supported, Parliament will then also have a vote on whether to seek a short time-limited extension to Article 50.

Christmas Eve Eve.

Here is where we are.

At 11pm 31st December, that is in less than eight days time from when I am writing this, the transition period ends, and the UK (except for Northern Ireland) is trading with the rest of the world (except where a new trade deal has been made already, which is … not many) on “WTO terms”. (This isn’t good.)

We’ve discussed at length earlier what Boris Johnson’s problem is trying to negotiate a deal: he needs to see everything in terms of winning and losing, and he needs to be able to present himself as the winner. This is not how trade deals work.



The European Parliament had its last plenary session on 17th December. No deal can be approved. The deadline to request an extension of the transition period passed on 30th June, even if Boris Johnson had been willing to ask for one.

The European Research Group are not enough MPs to overturn Boris Johnson’s 79-MP majority in the Commons, but they are likely enough MPs to trigger a leadership contest (55 letters is all it takes). The European Research Group are the MPs who want – who wanted all along – to be the winners and the victims simultaneously: to demand Brexit without defining Brexit, ot assert that only by leaving the EU and everything to do with it can they stop the EU from doing down the UK. It is impossible to make the ERG happy: if you gave them what they said they wanted, they would take that as a given and demand more and claim victimhood because they aren’t getting it.

If we crash out of the EU in no-deal Brexit on 31st December, the ERG MPs will still not be happy, because the UK will still have to trade with the perfidious countries of the EU, and collectively, they have far more economic clout than the UK did in its prime – and the UK is well past prime.

But crashing out in no-deal Brexit would have terrible and immediate consequences. The government’s “reasonable worst-case scenario” was laid out initially prior to the pandemic: when we are cresting a wave of infections for which the Tier 4 lockdown comes too late to prevent – this is, to put it blandly, an unreasonable worst-case scenario.

It is too late for a deal to be scrutinised by either the European or the Westminster Parliament before it is applied: it is not possible for the European Parliament to meet in plenary session now til January, and to be ratified by the EU, the 2000-page deal has to be translated into 27 official languages, voted on by 27 parliaments, and returned to the European Parliament. (I presume an emergency recall of Westminster Parliament could take place by Zoom, though Jacob Rees-Mogg has strenuously objected to such modern goings-on.)

If a deal is settled by close of day tomorrow, Christmas Eve, it is agreed the ambassadors of each country to the EU will meet, provisionally agree to it being applied to the UK-EU from 11pm 31st December, and an official letter (which is reckoned to take, by itself, four days to draft) will be sent out to each EU country for provisional approval.

The Westminster Parliament is likely to be recalled on Sunday 27th, two days in to Tier4 lockdown.

This will avoid, at least, the worst-case disruption – worse than that which a mere 48 hours of stoppages caused. The deal will still have to go through process for full ratification – and it is unlikely to make the ERG MPs happy: as noted earlier, it is unlikely that anything could make them happy. They have announced that as soon as the full text of the deal is public, they will convene what they refer to as their Star Chamber, and examine it in detail.

The Star Chamber was an invention of the Tudor monarchy, a court which had the power to punish crimes which might not be illegal but which loyal privy councillors to King Henry (7 or 8) felt ought to be illegal, and which English monarchs following found increasingly useful, to be able to declare something criminal and find people guilty and fine them, Sir William Blackstone notes drily in his Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765-1769) that it was abolished (1641) “to the general joy of the whole nation”.

It seems strangely appropriate that the Brexiter MPs should revive a legal name that had lived on only in metaphor for secretive procedings with no due process, and declare themselves the unlawful court of social and political oppression through the arbitrary use and abuse of power.

This convening of their Star Chamber means that when MPs return from recess in January and can scrutinise the 2000-page deal, which they have bound the UK to because it was that or crash out in no deal, the first Parliamentary scrutiny will be that of this semi-official group determined to find everything wrong with it they can.

Keir Starmer will likely have whipped Labour to agree to it: the SNP have already declared they will not vote for it: but with Labour MPs who obey Starmer and Conservative MPs who obey Johnson, the deal will pass.

But it is quite possible that, though Boris Johnson hopes to have this greeted as a grandstanding last-minute victory, now the deal is done and Johnson (and Starmer) can be held responsible for it, Johnson will be gone as soon as Tory MPs can figure out who they’re going to vote for to replace him.

So to be clear: if we hear a deal has been agreed to on Christmas Eve, we may stagger along a while longer – we will at least not be crashing out in no-deal Brexit.

If no deal has been agreed to by close of day Christmas Eve, then we really are finally out of time, and have a week left to contemplate what’s coming to us."

Joseph Russo was selected as the lead candidate for the new party in the Scottish constituency, should the UK take part in the elections in May.

However he has now announced on Twitter that he will not stand for election.

He said he was ""not fully prepared"" for the ""personal scrutiny"" he faced after ""offensive"" online posts came to light.

One of the new party's prospective London candidates, Ali Sadjady, also quit the race on Tuesday - hours after the party's lists were announced - over comments he had previously made on social media.

Change UK - which stems from the Independent Group of MPs who quit Labour and the Conservatives earlier this year - launched its campaign for the elections on Tuesday.

Mr Russo had topped the party's Scottish list, followed by David Macdonald, Kate Forman, Peter Griffiths, Heather Astbury and Catherine Edgeworth.

However, shortly after the list was announced, concerns were raised about old social media posts made by Mr Russo.

These have since been deleted, but screenshots appeared to show offensive comments about black women and Catholics, and that the police were targeting ""low lying fruit"" by arresting convicted sex offender Gary Glitter.

A spokesman for the party said that after discussion with Mr Russo about ""several offensive Twitter posts"", they had ""agreed that he will stand down and is no longer on our list of candidates""."

Brexit continued to be a feature of 2019 in the Information law world.
Brexit, however, will not stop being a feature of information law at 23:00 on 31st January (assuming there are no further delays).
Brexit also featured in the information law world in other respects as well.
This case provides some useful guidance on determining whether information is held, or not, for the purposes of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002.","blog, commissioner, scotland, law, appeal, data, court, information, act, 2019, protection","Well, it is that time again; the beginning of a New Year and therefore time for my third annual look at what happened in the world of information law in the previous twelve months and what those with an interest in the field should be looking out for in 2020. I would like to begin by wishing all readers of the Information Law Blog, both new and old, a very happy New Year.

My reviews of 2017 and 2018 began by looking at the case of Various Claimants v WM Morrisons Supermarkets Limited. I shall keep the tradition going by looking once again at this case. In 2018, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by Morrisons against the decision of Mr Justice Langstaff holding them vicariously liable for the actions of an ex-employee. This case rumbled on again in 2019, with the Supreme Court hearing an appeal by Morrisons on 6th and 7th November. By the end of 2019, the Supreme Court had not yet issued its judgment and so that will be something to look out for in 2020; the Supreme Court’s judgment (although concerned with the Data Protection Act 1998, rather than the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018) will have ramifications for data subjects and controllers, regardless of which way it goes.

Brexit continued to be a feature of 2019 in the Information law world. We have seen the changes that will take effect in data protection law as a result of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, which is now scheduled to take place at the end of this month. Brexit, however, will not stop being a feature of information law at 23:00 on 31st January (assuming there are no further delays). We will be in a transition period until the end of the year, but we don’t yet know exactly what we’re transitioning to which might start to become clearer by the Summer.

Brexit also featured in the information law world in other respects as well. There are still some data protection and privacy concerns floating around from the 2016 referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU. Indirectly related to that have been proceedings in the Upper Tribunal involving UKIP and in also in the First-Tier Tribunal. If reports are anything to go by, proceedings in the First-Tier Tribunal at the end of 2019 could result in an extremely critical decision against the Commissioner, so that is something to look out for in 2020.

We also saw the first GDPR administrative fine issued in the UK by the Information Commissioner (some 19 or so months after the GDPR became applicable and quite a bit behind other regulators in other EU Member States). The Commissioner has issued two Notices of Intent against two other Controllers (that we’re aware of) both of which were due to expire this month, but it has been confirmed by the Information Commissioner that the statutory six month period has been extended by agreement (in accordance with the statutory provisions). The reasons for this have not been made public at this time.

Just before Christmas the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice gave his opinion in Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland & Schrems concerning standard contractual clauses. We can expect a decision from the European Court of Justice to follow soon, whether that is before or after “exit day” at the end of January remains to be seen.

In the wider field of privacy law, the Court of Appeal took a look at the judgment of Mr Justice Arnold in the case involving Channel 5’s fly-on-the-wall documentary ‘Can’t Pay? We’ll Take it Away’. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals by the Respondents in respect of liability and the cross-appeal by the Claimants on the issue of quantum of damages. Meanwhile, in Scotland, Lord Bannatyne (for the first time) declared that there exists in the law of Scotland a common law right to privacy.

In May, Information Notices were again a feature of the decisions flowing from the First-Tier Tribunal; this time, however, it was concerning the Commissioner’s powers under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The Tribunal confirmed that the Commissioner can issue an information notice in order to obtain information as part of her process for determining whether a person is a public authority for the purposes of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

In 2019, the Scottish Parliament’s Public Audit and Post-Legislative Scrutiny Committee began undertaking Post-Legislative Scrutiny of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. In 2019, I gave both written and oral [pdf] evidence to the Committee. The Committee is expected to release its report and recommendations next month.

In 2019, we saw the expansion of FOI in Scotland with Registered Social Landlords formally being designated as Scottish public authorities for the purposes of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002.

We also had one of those rare things: a decision from the Court of Session in an appeal against a decision of the Scottish Information Commissioner. In the sole decision in such an appeal issued by the Court of Session in 2019, my client successfully challenged (on a point of law) a finding by the Commissioner that information he had requested was not held by a local council for the purpose of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. This case provides some useful guidance on determining whether information is held, or not, for the purposes of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002.

Unless the polls are seriously wrong they can expect to win the most seats when votes are counted on Sunday 26 May.

It's less easy to say who is in second place - largely because there is a huge range between estimates for Labour's share of the vote. YouGov has them on 13% whereas Panelbase has 25%.

Our Finance & Projects Manager, Gordon Dickson represented the Scottish Artists Union. Here are his notes he used to contribute to the discussion as part of the session.

Impacts of Brexit

We survey our members each year. This year we asked two questions regarding Brexit. ""Two years on from the Brexit vote, what has the impact been on your practice?"" and ""As 'Brexit Day' approaches what impact do you think leaving the EU will have on your future plans in relation to your work?""

Individual Impact on our Members

EU Citizens living and working in Scotland and the freedom of movement and opportunity abroad.

“Living in Scotland as the spouse of an EU Citizen, makes me feel somewhat insecure, given the unreliability of the Home Office.”

European Suppliers

Members already seeing costs of materials from rest of EU suppliers increasing. There is a concern this will become worse or impossible after Brexit.

“European suppliers increased prices by 10% citing Brexit to my framer, who then pass those costs onto me.”

Selling to Europe

Brexit may see increased costs in selling work to EU.

“It will make it harder for me to ship work to clients in Europe, and I will have to charge them extra import/export fees.”

European Funding

Members fear the end of working on pan-EU projects, collaborating across borders with artists in other countries. Also, concern about the perception of UK as withdrawing not juts from EU but from collaborating with others.

“It will make it more difficult to take up opportunities in Europe or collaborate with artists and institutions in Europe, so not great in terms of professional and artistic development.”

EU and Highlands & Islands

Great concern in H&I as lots of arts funding comes from EU, putting at risk the whole cultural sector.

“Based in the H&I much of our infrastructure has been reliant on EU funding; Therefore I can see less support for culture and the arts.”

Economic Uncertainty

Members are already seeing an impact on the market for their work. Brexit’s impact on the woodier economy means less artwork being bought.

“Sales in this area have plummeted, galleries are closing down.”

Uncertainty in General

Because there is still so much uncertainty around Brexit, many find it difficult to prepare for it or identify what the impact may be.

“I have been working hard to develop connections and relationships with artists and curators in Germany & France, and I am very concerned that Brexit has undermined these connections, especially opportunities for EU funding.”

Our colleagues at the Scottish Contemporary Arts Network are conducting a survey of their own on the impacts of Brexit on the visual arts in Scotland. Find out more here."

Scotland will have another independence referendum in the event of Britain leaving the European Union — dubbed a Brexit — and will opt to leave the UK, former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond said on Thursday night.

Salmond, who was Scotland's leader between 2007-2014, said in a televised debate that if Scotland was ""dragged"" out of the EU by voters, then Scots will want to sever the 309-year-old tie with Britain.

""[The second Scottish independence referendum] would have to be within the two-year period of the UK negotiating to withdraw [from the EU],"" said Salmond.

""If you had the situation where Scotland, in four weeks' time, votes Remain and the rest of the UK or England drags Scotland out by voting to leave, then that would justify, in my opinion, another referendum.

""In the circumstances of Scotland being threatened with being dragged out of the EU against our will, I think the result would be 'Yes' this time.""

Scots voted for their country to stay part of the UK on September 19, 2014 — but the vote was tight. Pro-unionists won by a much closer vote than expected – just over 55% voted ""No"" when asked ""Scotland should be an independent country?"" while 44% opted to leave.

A poll published earlier this month showed that Britons are more worried about the prospect of Scotland gaining independence than of the UK leaving the EU.

A BMG poll for Scotland's Herald newspaper, which canvassed 1,512 people across the UK between April 21 and 26, found that 68% of voters cited Scottish secession from the UK as their least preferred option when compared to Britain leaving the EU, which got 32% backing.

The latest poll numbers for the EU referendum this week show the race for a Brexit and those opting to remain in the union are neck-and-neck:

YouGov online poll: Remain 41 / Leave 41

ICM online poll: Remain 45 / Leave 45

Meanwhile, a Survation opinion poll conducted on behalf of financial trading group IG shows that 54% of respondents plan to vote for Britain to stay in the EU, compared to 46% who said they'll back a Brexit, excluding undecided voters.

This week, G7 leaders warned a Brexit would be a serious risk to global economic growth.

""A UK exit from the EU would reverse the trend towards greater global trade and investment, and the jobs they create, and is a further serious risk to growth,"" said G7 leaders said, in the only reference to the vote in a 32-page declaration."

GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - The only solution to Scotland's Brexit problem is to split from the United Kingdom, Nicola Sturgeon told her Scottish National Party (SNP) on Tuesday.

Britain's 52-48 percent 2016 vote to leave the European Union has put the four-nation United Kingdom at loggerheads; England and Wales voted to leave but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.

Sturgeon, who is also Scotland's first minister, said that the ""contempt"" shown by the British government toward Scotland during Brexit negotiations so far showed the UK was not a union of equals.

""Brexit is a serious problem for Scotland,"" she told the SNP conference, arguing that Brexit had made it even more evident that Scotland's future was not in its own hands because it would leave the EU against its will.

""The only solution to that is to become an independent country,"" she said, adding she was more and more confident it would happen.

Thomson Reuters

LONDON (Reuters) - Scotland will publish proposals this week for how it can remain in the European single market after Britain leaves the European Union in order to avoid the ""national disaster"" of a ""hard Brexit"", the Scottish government said on Sunday.

British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the formal process of leaving the EU, by the end of March to kick off two years of exit talks.

However, her plans for those negotiations have been shrouded in secrecy and businesses and investors fear Britain might seek a ""hard Brexit"" where controlling immigration takes priority over access to the European single market.

While the United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave the EU in the June 23 referendum, Scotland strongly backed remaining in the bloc.

The country's devolved nationalist government has said it wants to stay part of the EU when the rest of the UK leaves, and on Tuesday will put forward plans for remaining in the 500 million-consumer single market should that prove impossible.

""In line with our commitments to explore all options to protect Scotland's interests, we will set out compromise proposals which, while not conferring the full benefits of EU membership, would mitigate the Brexit damage,"" said Michael Russell, the Scottish government's minister for EU negotiations.

""At the heart of our plan is a framework to keep Scotland's place in the European Single Market.""

Russell said such a plan faced ""complexities"" but a ""hard Brexit"" threatened 80,000 Scottish jobs over a decade.

""That would be a national disaster for Scotland,"" he said. ""Brexit presents everyone with an unprecedented challenge, and with political goodwill on all sides and a willingness to cooperate, these proposals can effect a solution for Scotland.""

The plans also will outline further ""substantial"" new powers that should be handed to the devolved parliament in Edinburgh post-Brexit.

May has promised to work with the devolved Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments to achieve a unified negotiating strategy for Brexit, which risks straining the centuries-old union between England and Scotland.

Scots rejected secession in a 2014 referendum but the ruling Scottish National Party has warned it might hold a second independence vote.

""Our intention now is that these proposals can be discussed and agreed in a UK context and then form part of the UK government's overall negotiating position when Article 50 is triggered,"" Russell said."

The subject was Race, History and Brexit: Exploring the politics of erasure and documenting the experiences of Black and minority ethnic communities in Scotland post Brexit.

I was proud to speak alongside Dr Ima Jackson and Dr Akwugo Emejulu – both due to their scholarship, and because it was the first time in my career I had sat on a panel composed entirely of Black women.

I am Black. I am Scottish. To some, it’s obvious that the two are not mutually exclusive. To others, Black Scottish identity is a contradiction in terms: either you’re of this place, Scottish and therefore white, or Other, Black. Rest assured, the two fit together – admittedly there are tensions, but those mostly arise from the expectations of other people (read: white people) rather than any aspect of what it actually is to be Black and Scottish. The plurality of Black identity often gets lost in how this discussion is approached, because constructions of national identity are so often treated as binary and static.

“Where are you from, originally?” Five words that plague people of colour across Britain. It’s essentially code for “if you’re here, then why aren’t you white?” When I was a child that question left me feeling sick, scared. I dreaded it, and have developed something of a sixth sense for when it’s coming. What caused me discomfort was that it positioned me as Other, and was often asked because white people couldn’t wrap their heads around the idea of a Black child belonging in an otherwise white family. Now, having grown up and inhabited this world as a Black woman for 24 years, I have a much thicker skin when it comes to micro-aggressions. But people still ask it. Random strangers still feel entitled to ask that, completely out of the blue, their curiosity outweighing basic courtesy.

That question can’t be separated from what it is to be Black and Scottish. It’s an indicator of how white people consider Scottishness, what can and cannot be Scottish. The underlying assumption around which the question is framed is that Scottish identity is inherently white. So please spare me the justifications that it was “small talk” or “friendly interest”. It’s the politics of us and them playing out on a local scale. The greater the incredulity directed towards my Scottishness, the harder it is for the person asking where I’m from to imagine that the categories of us and them aren’t necessarily poles apart.

Always, people are perplexed when I answer with my hometown, on the west coast of Scotland. This doesn’t compute. And that puzzlement grows when they ask, searching carefully for a combination of words that doesn’t sound racist, where I came from “before that”. The amount of truth I share depends on how salty I’m feeling that day – the maternity unit of the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow or, if they try their luck yet again, my mother’s uterus. Talking explicitly about female biology and birth is a great way to return the discomfort – that horror of women’s bodies so often coincides with casual racism.

My Scottish identity is incompatible with their vision of Scottishness. The idea of me having been born “here”, grown up “here”, is fundamentally at odds with their idea of what it is to be Scottish, a vision of Scotland in which the whiteness of natives is ubiquitous. And yet I did grow up “here”, which is why the cognitive dissonance surrounding Scotland’s approach to the politics of Brexit and national identity is so clear to me.

There is a colossal rift between this image of a progressive Scotland committed to social justice and the reality of a Scotland in denial over its colonial legacy. The People Make Glasgow – that’s been our city’s slogan since the Commonwealth Games. Which people, though? Who did make Glasgow? Glasgow merchants of the 18th century amassed fortunes on the back of the slave trade, and slave labour in colonies used to produce tobacco, sugar, and rum. The GOMA, St. Andrew’s in the Square, whole sections of Merchant City – so many of those beautiful buildings were built from that wealth. Wealth created through the exploitation and abuse of Black people. Glasgow wouldn’t exist as we know it without the wealth amassed through slavery, colonialism. That stunning architecture is treated as a source of national pride, but what made it possible is to the shame of Scotland as a nation.

But we don’t like to talk about that. I remember learning about the Empire in school. It was romanticised to the point that the ethics of white people profiting from the slave labour provided by Black people were never unpacked in the classroom. The horror of Imperialism was completely glossed over, the implication being that “civilisation” and a railway system in India made it fair exchange. Of course, making these atrocities palatable for children involves a tacit denial of Black and brown humanity – if British paternalism (and I do include Scotland in that) was overall beneficial, a benign presence across the Empire, then colonial subjects were primitives in need of guidance from white rationality. This construction relies on depicting us as Other, less human than the civilising force of whiteness.

My mum took me to the David Livingstone Centre in Blantyre when I was a kid. At the time, it was just another day out. We saw where he lived, learned that he was a missionary and explorer. Livingstone is even framed as something of a hero for his opposition to the slave trade. That he sought to challenge slavery through “Christianity, Commerce and Civilization” – ridding the continent of barbarism and working towards more efficient ways for Britain to exploit African resources – was largely overlooked. I had intended to revisit the centre before this event, but it is closed for refurbishment.

I don’t recall any specific attention being given to the African men and women on whose lives David Livingstone impacted. His reliance on the slave labour he allegedly stood against, that hypocrisy, wasn’t really considered. The stories of Black men and women were so invisible that I was puzzled by the sticker book I got from the gift shop. It was about a little Black girl who lived in a village, and what did little Black girls have to do with David Livingstone? Still, it was the only sticker book I’d ever got with a Black character, which was so exciting that this line of enquiry receded in my ten year old mind.

None of this history receives due critical exploration. It’s left to fester, and the ways in which Scotland’s history of profiting from slave labour, being a part of Imperial expansion, is largely unaddressed. Existing attitudes cannot be divorced from the historical context that brought them into being.

The narrative of Scottish exceptionalism erases the atrocities of slavery, absolves the Scottish conscience, and allows us to imagine this country as being a fundamentally fairer place than England. The politics of Brexit are not new, and Scotland – in spite of having voted to remain – is not exempt. Scotland has been a part of a context in which that xenophobia and racism has flourished, unchallenged."

							Food Intolerance is now so common, for reasons we'll explain, that it's important to know how to tell if you or your children are suffering from food intolerance to ensure that you don't trigger symptoms of illness and even chronic conditions. Symptoms can emerge up to 3 days after eating the suspect food and intolerances can occur for healthy foods too like broccoli, ginger and pineapple!

She said the speech would restate her government's backing for continued EU membership and shared European values.

The SNP leader also said the Foreign Office had been ""childish"" for cutting off diplomatic support for the trip.

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt - one of the candidates for the Conservative leadership - had asked that the Scottish government provide its own logistical support for the visit, due to concerns Ms Sturgeon was using the trip to undermine UK policies on Brexit and promote Scottish independence.

Talks over the UK's exit from the EU have been deadlocked for months, and have now taken a back seat to the leadership contest which will decide who replaces Theresa May as prime minister.

All 10 candidates in the running have pledged to deliver Brexit, but are divided on how and when to do so.

Ahead of her speech at the European Policy Centre, Ms Sturgeon said people in Scotland had ""shown that they comprehensively reject Brexit and want to remain as a European nation"".

She added: ""Membership of the EU not only has huge economic benefits for Scotland, but is the basis of the core values we share around democracy, equality, co-operation and human rights.

""My engagements in Brussels are an opportunity to outline the Scottish government's support for those values and how they contribute to a better Scotland, Europe and wider world.

""On issues such as climate change and tackling inequality we can all work together to ensure the wellbeing of our citizens, as well as the wealth of member states."""

93686,Scotland’s Place In Europe,https://www.socialeurope.eu/scotlands-place-europe,14/06/2019,Politics,BREXIT,True,"We have long made clear the value the Scottish Government places on our membership of the EU.
Our continued membership of the European single market, including the four freedoms, is central to the health of our economy and our prosperity as a nation.
It is not just our relationship with Europe that is at stake, but our wellbeing as a nation.
The Prime Minister has now signalled a refusal to engage on the terms of a referendum before Brexit takes place.
This is the latest contribution to a new Social Europe Project on ‘Europe after Brexit’ organised in cooperation with the Macroeconomic Policy Institute of the Hans Böckler Stiftung and the Bertelsmann Stiftung.","scotland, uk, membership, eu, europe, brexit, proposals, market, place, minister, scottish, scotlands, single","In June 2016, the people of Scotland overwhelmingly expressed their wish to remain part of the EU. As the UK Government is readying to trigger the Article 50 process –against the will of the people of Scotland – the question we must ask is: do we want to be an open, forward-looking progressive Scotland that protects its own interests, or are we willing to be overlooked and pushed off a hard Brexit cliff edge, with damaging consequences for our economy, society and our place in the world?

The First Minister took the first steps last week towards giving the people of Scotland the right to make that choice, in an independence referendum.

We have long made clear the value the Scottish Government places on our membership of the EU. We value strongly the economic benefits, rights and social protections it affords the people of Scotland, and we want to see them continue.

Our continued membership of the European single market, including the four freedoms, is central to the health of our economy and our prosperity as a nation. And we are doing everything we possibly can, legislatively, practically and in every other sense, to protect the rights of EU nationals living in Scotland.

In December last year we set out a series of proposals to the UK Government which made clear the importance of single market membership to our economy and proposed a way forward to protect Scotland’s interests and mitigate the worst damage of a hard Brexit – which could cost 80,000 Scottish jobs within a decade.

The Scottish Government has negotiated with the UK Government in good faith. Our proposals were put forward in the spirit of seeking consensus, but have so far been ignored. Despite saying they would give our proposals careful consideration, disappointingly, UK Ministers have refused to match our compromises with any of theirs.

If Scotland can be ignored on an issue as important as our membership of the EU and the single market, then it is clear that our voice and our interests can be ignored at any time, and on any issue.

It is not just our relationship with Europe that is at stake, but our wellbeing as a nation. Brexit will inevitably hit our economy, our public spending and living standards; its consequences are set to affect many of our economic sectors, from our social care sector to our education system and, more generally, our business relationships, both internally and internationally.

Not only that, our political autonomy and democratic asset are under threat: after our strenuous fight for an extension to our responsibilities, we now are faced with the prospect of a further centralisation of power to Westminster. We’ve heard statements from the Prime Minister that she wants increased centralised power at Westminster when powers previously held by the EU are returned – not to devolved administrations.

This cannot be a secure basis on which to build a better, fairer, more prosperous Scotland.

Almost seven months since the EU referendum, the Prime Minister has announced ending UK involvement in the European project in the hardest and most complete way possible. We think this is the wrong decision for the UK as a whole and it indicates that the type of country they want is a race to the bottom, sacrificing consumer, environmental and workers’ rights for the price of deregulation and low wages.

But the Scottish Government – and the Scottish people as indicated in poll after poll – have a different view. We have to find a fresh way forward – a new beginning – that honours the democratic demand of the nation to maintain our relationship with our European friends and neighbours.

If the UK leaves the EU without Scotland indicating beforehand – or at least within a short time after it – that we want a different relationship, we could face a lengthy period outside not just the EU but also the single market. That could make the task of negotiating a different future much more difficult.

The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, last week made clear she is determined to regain control for Scotland, so that our people have the opportunity to decide their own future and determine their own direction of travel.

By asking the Scottish Parliament to agree that we should take forward the Section 30 process for a Scottish independence referendum between Autumn 2018 and Spring 2019 – once we know the shape of the Brexit negotiations, we are taking the necessary steps to make sure the people of Scotland can exercise the right to choose their own future.

We need to make sure that people have choice at the right time; any clarity about the hard Brexit deal that we’re expecting has to be on the table, people will need to have that laid out for them. It is our determination to make sure that Scotland’s voice is heard.

The Prime Minister has now signalled a refusal to engage on the terms of a referendum before Brexit takes place. That would, in effect, mean preventing the people of Scotland having a choice over their future. That would be a democratic outrage.

We will put our proposition, based firmly on this government’s democratic mandate, to the Scottish Parliament this week, and then we will put our formal proposals to the UK Government. The Scottish Parliament vote will ensure this nation’s voice will be heard.

This is the latest contribution to a new Social Europe Project on ‘Europe after Brexit’ organised in cooperation with the Macroeconomic Policy Institute of the Hans Böckler Stiftung and the Bertelsmann Stiftung."

No amount of deflection can disguise the truth of this. The Scots blew it. The hard work had been done, a commanding lead had been established in style, and they folded.

To say anything else would be to patronise the players. To soft-soap it and call it unfair or unlucky would open up accusations of treating the women's team differently to the men's team. To bang on about being robbed while brushing away the colossal errors in the endgame would be insultingly condescending.

Resilience got Scotland to the World Cup in the first place, but the most desperate fragility brought about their demise.

At 3-0, with 15 minutes to play, Scotland got suckered and conceded a goal. It was largely self-inflicted but at the time it had the air of consolation. It was Argentina's first goal of the tournament and they looked relieved to get it.

Instead of leaders emerging and a game plan of consolidation being implemented, Scotland lost all composure. They gave the ball away, they gave Argentina hope. They rushed when they needed to slow down and bring some nous to the occasion.

The second goal was a catastrophe of slack defending and deficient goalkeeping. The penalty, conceded rashly by a player who had lost the plot despite being on the field for mere seconds, was the debacle in microcosm."

I'm really excited for it. You might think I'd be desperate for a goal after going close a couple of times in the first two games, but I'm just desperate for three points. Argentina will fancy their chances after getting a point with Japan and narrowly losing to England because, if they beat us, they can still finish second. I'll be honest, I've been a bit surprised by just how good they've been and their ranking doesn't do them justice, so it's going to be a really tough match.

I know some people will have been looking at all the goal difference stuff in the other groups to work out what we need to do to finish as one of the best third-placed sides, but we just need to win. If you start worrying about what you can't control, it can affect you, so all we can do is get the three points, take a breather, then do the maths.

Mr Lidington was speaking ahead of Mrs May's speech on the future of the union in Scotland on Thursday.

He warned a no-deal Brexit would exacerbate tensions - and that if the next prime minister made the wrong decisions, it could mean the end of the UK."

Unsurprisingly, I've never stayed in a chateau before. It's not the kind of thing people from Irvine do on their holidays.

I suppose being at the World Cup is about making memories and having new experiences and this is certainly one of them.

Rennes was 15 degrees, rain, thunder forecast when we arrived on Monday - not quite the same as Nice, which was an incredible place and like nowhere I'd ever been before, even the Costa del Ayrshire. It was only a couple of hours on the plane but what a difference.

Still, the flight - and the hour delay sitting on the runway in Nice - gave me time to start a new boxset. I've hummed and hawed over a few things since we've been here but I've been desperately waiting for the second season of Killing Eve and the whole lot is now on the iPlayer so I got battered into that.

We've not been able to watch Love Island either, because the signal wasn't great in the hotel in Nice so I struggled to get it loaded. Raging. I've been avoiding social media at the times it's on because I can't be having spoilers but I'm now thinking it's maybe too far gone for me to start... unless I binge-watch a load of them on our day off.

The Nintendo didn't even get out of the case in Nice because we were pretty central and had a lot of family time, and we couldn't get it hooked up to the TV here. So we had a 'games day' instead on Tuesday of darts, snooker and mini golf, which Claire Emslie beat me at.

We've also got a teqball table, which is like football table tennis. I think the girls at Arsenal have one at the training ground so Lisa was good at it, but so was Lee Alexander. Mind you, she was on it most of the day mastering it. It's all about bragging rights and whoever gets beat will get a slagging."

One of the arguments made for Brexit is that the Westminster government can go out to the world with a new global strategy, and strike trade deals that are better suited to UK exporters' interests.

Maybe so. But what we should know by now is that such deals are complex and take time. And, at least initially, the UK's need to get deals done means that it starts with a negotiating disadvantage.

That's quite apart from the long-term problem of having a smaller domestic market than the EU, and therefore less with which to negotiate.

Post-Brexit, the UK may be able to negotiate deals which would see whisky tariffs reduced to zero. But it would surely require compromise elsewhere, on the priorities of those trading partners on the other side of the negotiating table. In India, for instance, that starts with work visas.

Until Britain can get those trade deals signed, Scotch whisky will be operating at a disadvantage, facing tariffs of as much as 45% - whereas, for instance, Irish whiskey distillers can look forward to no tariff at all.

If you were running an Irish distillery, you would probably use the opportunity to grow your share of those fast-growing export markets in South America and Asia."

The same faces kept showing up – like Jimmy Somerville, Paul Weller, Tom Robinson – and we all shared similar ideals. Those were the darkest days of the Thatcherite 80s, as well. There was a feeling that something had to be done.



Neil Spencer (Red Wedge press officer): The bus left from Paul Weller’s Solid Bond studio at Marble Arch. It was a bitterly cold day in the middle of winter, and there were a dozen assorted musicians and crew with bags and boxes all over the pavement, and cabbies looking at us as they drove by.

The atmosphere on the bus was electric. There had been nothing like this since the package tours in the 60s. Musicians in the 80s tended to live very segregated lives, but when they had a chance like this to collaborate, they really loved it. Everybody left their egos at the door of the bus and mucked in.

Tom Robinson: The nuts-and-bolts organisation of the tour was down to Paul Weller. It was his touring crew that put the whole thing together. I’ve done a lot of benefits and worthy gigs, and organisation can often be pretty dreadful, but on Red Wedge we’d arrive at a gig and everything would be signposted “This way to dressing rooms” or “Canteen: second on right”. The very fact that there was a canteen was amazing. Sound checks happened on time every day.

Bragg: Weller’s tour manager, Kenny Wheeler, was frighteningly efficient. He kept track of everything and had a system of fines. If you lost your tour pass, for example, you were fined five quid on the spot.

Spencer: First man on the bus every day was Billy Bragg. He treated the whole thing like a military exercise, but Jimmy Somerville drove Kenny up the wall. He was last on every day, and he also had a habit of bus-surfing. He would stand on one leg right behind the driver with his arms out to one side like he was surfing. The big surprise was Richard Coles, the other half of the Communards. He’s a very quiet guy, bespectacled, almost professorial, and then suddenly he’d turn into Paul Daniels and start doing all these brilliant card tricks. Jerry Dammers’ function was to sit red-eyed in the back of the bus with a huge blaster playing reggae at fuck-off volume.

Jimmy Somerville: We supplied the camp element. We particularly wanted to do it in order to provide Red Wedge’s gay visibility. Labour in those days still had a very cloth-cap mentality and we wanted to help change that. We were very out and proud then, and it was great to be two very loud gay blokes in this bus full of straight men.

Bragg: I think the guy I was most pleased to see on the bus was Junior [Giscombe], because he was the one with the most to lose. Musically and socially he came from a different background than the rest of us, so it was great that he came.

Spencer: As well as playing gigs, the musicians had to do press conferences, a lot of meeting and greeting, mixing with local MPs and union dignitaries, people who had never encountered rock musicians and were, frankly, out of their depth.

They expected the tour to be a gong-banging exercise for the Labour party, but we were much more ambivalent about it. So you had these very stolid, long-term party members suddenly finding themselves confronted by young people who wanted to talk about the environment, gay rights, minorities, and to get all these things on the Labour party agenda.

Paul Weller: The MPs we’d meet around the country were more showbiz than the groups. It was an eye-opener; it brought me full circle in how I feel about politics. It’s a game. I’ve very little interest in it. I’m not talking about what’s happening to our planet or our country, but about organised politics.

Tom Robinson: The artists got along very well, but these politicians would turn up and want to go on stage. The last thing we wanted was hardline party blokes going out there and lecturing the crowd on the evils of capitalism. That’s not how you change the minds of rock fans. We had to keep finding new ways of keeping them off.

Spencer: Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet turned up to do an acoustic set in Manchester. It amazed everybody because Spandau were not what most people thought of as a socialist band, but he was politically well sussed and he played a great set.

Somerville: One of the best things for me was duetting with Billy Bragg on Tracks of My Tears, because I had a bit of a crush on him at the time. I think he knew it too. I mean, you can’t help it, can you? He’s pretty irresistible.

Robinson: One curious thing was that Jerry Dammers refused to do Free Nelson Mandela. We were all keen to learn the chords and have a bash at it because it was perfect for what we were about, but I think he didn’t trust us to do it well enough. In retrospect, maybe he was right.

Lloyd Cole: Billy Bragg asked me to do some dates, and I like him and broadly agree with his politics, so I said yes. Besides, it was an excuse for me to play one of my favourite songs, Read It in Books by [Echo and] the Bunnymen. When I arrived at the Birmingham Odeon, Weller came up to me and demanded to know why I had slagged off his single Walls Come Tumbling Down. I told him it was because I thought it was crap and he said: “Well, Forest Fire ain’t changing nothing”, to which I had to agree. Then he said: “So you really slagged my song off?” I said “Yes” again and he looked at me for a minute, then said: “That’s all right then. Everybody else tries to deny it.”

Red Wedge on tour.

Bragg: The highlight of the gig in Bradford was Joolz, the punk poetess. She did an impassioned poem all about growing up in Bradford and how she was saddened at the way the city had been allowed to go to ruin. It got more and more passionate and intense, and she held that crowd utterly spellbound, totally silent. I remember standing by the mixing desk and thinking: Incredible – if I’d paid money to see this, I’d be over the moon.

Robinson: There was a real sense of solidarity. When Junior came on in Leicester, he started getting some racist shit from, of all people, some Billy Bragg fans. He rode it out with great dignity and carried it off, and we all crowded round the front of the stage. I was on next so I went out and gave them a bit of a lecture about the measure of a civilised country being how well it treats its minorities and then, to ram the point home, I went straight into Glad to Be Gay.

Bragg: One song I loved doing was Move on Up, as a result of which the Style Council, rather unkindly when I think about it, referred to me as Curtis Mallard for the rest of the tour.

Robinson: Runrig turned up at Edinburgh Playhouse and most of us didn’t have a clue who they were. Then they went out on stage and the whole place went apeshit. Amazing. We were all standing at the side saying: “Who are these guys?”

Donnie Munroe (Runrig): It was unusual for us, back then, to be suddenly thrust among all these top chart acts, but we were really delighted to be able to do the show. We did Dance Called America, because it was about forced emigration from Scotland, and feudalism, and it related to the sense of loss of community that we were experiencing under Thatcherism.

Bragg: Newcastle was heaven and hell. The best gig but the worst day. Right through the tour we had constant problems with the extremists, like our friends in the Young Socialists. They would make promises, without bothering to tell us, that Red Wedge acts would perform in various halls and community centres and so on in the afternoons before the gigs. Then, at the last minute, we’d find out and have to rush off to save their bacon.

Some clown promised the Riverside Club in Newcastle that Red Wedge bands would play there at lunchtime. The poor bloke running the hall ended up with 500 restless Geordies starting to turn a bit grim, and no sign of an act. As it happened, Elvis Costello was playing on The Tube that day, which was done in studios in Newcastle, so somebody had the wit to run round and ask him if he’d come and do something. He had nothing to do with Red Wedge but, God bless him, he went along there and played, probably because he knew there’d be a riot if he didn’t.

Robinson: It was a real shock at Newcastle city hall when the Smiths turned up. Johnny Marr had been around at a couple of shows, but we never expected Morrissey to show. I’d never been a Smiths fan up to that point but I have to say that from the moment they took the stage, they just blew the place away. This was a bona fide rock band at the height of its powers.

Rhoda Dakar (singer, Red Wedge steering committee chair): There wasn’t much sex and drugs and all that on Red Wedge. We didn’t throw TVs out of windows. The last night, we stayed in a castle at Chester-le-Street and got around to playing Murder in the Dark. Jerry Dammers somehow got put into a large box and didn’t get out again until the morning.

Spencer: Room No 4 in the castle was said to be haunted, and Junior Giscombe was telling these brilliant, really scary ghost stories. When Kenny allocated Billy Bragg to Room 4, he bottled out, muttering something about The Shining.

Bragg: Kenny Wheeler was always so proud that he had never lost anybody on a tour, then on that final leg back to London, Mick Talbot of the Style Council somehow didn’t get back on the bus. We’d been on the M1 for about an hour before anybody realised we’d left him at Leicester Forest East service station.

Weller: Looking back, it wasn’t me at all. I’m not into meetings and being part of somebody’s club. I believed in what I believed in, and a lot of those things I still do, but I’d never get involved again.

Bragg: There was a feeling immediately afterward that we hadn’t actually achieved very much, but now, in retrospect, I think we did. We hadn’t set out to change the world, just to create some common ground between young people and the Labour party. I think that’s what we did.

Voiceover man hails ""the decade that just won't die"" – which is true, even though, along with a large number of like-minded people, I spent most of the 80s doing my best to kill them. But with shoulder pads and bad prints being the order of the day summer-fashion-wise, with Wire magazine championing a genre of music they call ""hypnagogic pop"" (""it refashions 80s chart pop-rock into a hazy, psychedelic drone"") and with the release of two blockbusting remakes on the same day – The Karate Kid and The A-Team – it seems that the 80s zombie everpresence is being reaffirmed, in pop culture and, so I'd argue, just about everywhere else. Like it or not, the 80s are still what made us who we are today.

But why is anyone even bothering to revisit pap like The Karate Kid and crap like The A-Team? Is it just that we're reaching the final splintery barrel scrapings? Or could it be that there were some things that the 80s did much better than we do them now? This is something I have been loth to admit, but I'm starting to come around to it.

My slowly emerging respect, if not love, for the 1980s is not based on any lurking nostalgia I might have for my teenage decade. At the time I hated the time. I was 11 when we kissed 1979 goodbye, with the kids' chorus on Pink Floyd's Another Brick in the Wall succinctly expressing my views on pedagogy, life, the universe and everything (as per Douglas Adams). Much of the coming decade gave me a kind of sick-in-the-back-of-the-mouth cultural nausea. I didn't really get rid of this taste until I decamped to Prague in the spring of 1990. On the streets there, not much had changed since before the Velvet Revolution – the red stars had been removed from the buildings all down Wenceslas Square, soon to be replaced by adverts for pilsner. Prices were still pegged at their communist levels. Jeans, too, were still pegged and stonewashed. But it felt like a different place. And I felt as if I'd escaped from Margaret Thatcher. She was harder to shake off than I anticipated, however.

The 80s turned out to be both the climax and the anticlimax of the cold war – a political conclusion that miraculously sidestepped nuclear war. And the more I think about it – and I've been thinking about it a lot recently – the more I see that it's only as a mess of competing and overlapping micro-cold wars that the 80s can be understood.

Philip Roth, in his lesser-known novella The Prague Orgy, made the clinching observation about the difference between the Soviet bloc and the US. ""There, nothing goes and everything matters; here, everything goes and nothing matters."" John Lydon put it even more succinctly in the Sex Pistols' Holidays in the Sun: ""I'm looking over the wall, and they're looking at me.""

The 80s were very much about cold war walls, with ""us"" on one side and ""them"" on the other: the west v the east, America v England, left v right. It's hard to see such polarisation in today's pop culture. Everyone admits to guilty pleasures. Everyone sneaks off and enjoys a junk food blowout, a multiplex no-brainer, Girls Aloud. To boycott things entirely seems over-strident, pointless. What do you think you're going to achieve?

But ironic consumption was something that the 80s pioneered. At my university in 1986, the cult movie was Top Gun. Students in groups of eight or 10 would go to see it, again and again. They would single out girls at student discos and serenade them with Unchained Melody. As they boarded buses, they would chant, ""I feel the need, the need for speed."" They were revelling in the beginnings of a so-bad-it's-good spree that continues to this day.

For some of us, though, bad meant evil. In communist countries during the 1980s, dissidents did their best to annoy, outwit and undermine the apparatchiks with ironic gestures. Their more serious work, though, was the creation of alternative culture – a space where open political debate could take place, where important books were distributed in lovingly typed samizdat editions.

One way I have of understanding my total devotion to the Smiths between 1984 and 1989 is as a minor form of cultural dissidence. The Smiths are rarely seen as a political band – not when compared to the Redskins or even the Jam. Their ideological stance is too easy to parody as an extended bedroom sulk. But Morrissey was one of the few public figures to say anything as overt as ""the sorrow of the Brighton bombing is that Thatcher escaped unscathed"". To go along with being a Smiths fan involved a great deal of anti-consumerism. Meat was murder. Clothes came from charity shops, or your mum's bottom drawer. Music was supplied by genuinely independent labels – and the latest 12-inch remix from Level 42 was a work of the corporate devil. In other words, we were boycotting most of the world.

And this is where it gets complicated, because, looking back, I seem to find myself looking at myself over a wall. From 2010, where everything goes and nothing matters, Britain in the 1980s very much looks like a communist domain where nothing went and everything mattered.

Among the things, pop-culturally, that mattered most of all was Top of the Pops. If a film is bad, these days we say, ""I want those two hours back."" But if there was a really bad record in the higher reaches of the charts in the 80s, that meant you could anticipate a wasted four minutes of your life, waiting for it to finish and the next bad record to come on. But you couldn't not watch TOTP altogether, because there was just that chance that something life-changing (like the Smiths) might come along.

You weren't entirely alone in this. To see John Peel's grimace after he introduced, say, Barry Manilow was to know that some of ""us"" were working away in close proximity to white-socked partytime posers like Bruno Brookes or Gary Davies.

It's the ""everything matters"" aspect of the 80s that has started to turn my opinion of them around. One of the main messages of 80s Hollywood was ""you can change your life"". Often, this was done in some astonishingly vile ways. There's a mini-genre of movies which I've been having some fun trying to identify: the self-betterment-through-prostitution film. These include American Gigolo and Pretty Woman (1990, but filmed in the previous year). There's also the get-ahead-by-running-a-brothel mini-genre, such as the Tom Cruise vehicle Risky Business or Henry ""the Fonz"" Winkler's Night Shift – where the brothel is in a morgue. This kind of thing was acceptable then.

But the most iconic cinematic mode of the 80s was the sports training montage, as showcased in Rocky. This was a shortcut way for Hollywood to deal with the growing influence of music videos from MTV (not launched in this-side-of-the-wall Europe until 1987). Soundtracked by crashing synth-drums and AOR power chords, the montage showed self-improvement in catchy action – as the hero or heroine worked till they were musclebound. Ludicrous, I know. But it's hard to find anything with a similar get-ahead conviction these days. Fates tend to be accepted and lived with, not turned around. And, as a result, we're very good at something the 80s did disastrously or not at all – disaster movies.

Similarly, although 80s cinema seemed at the time to be about rapacious individualism, the moral of a film like The Breakfast Club was that if you put a jock, a geek, a criminal, a prom queen and a kook together for long enough, they'll find out they have a lot in common. Compare this to Twilight – imagine the carnage of a Saturday morning detention at Forks high school. Twilight's message is clear: some of us are vampires, some are werewolves, and never the twain shall share a lunchbox.

Rocky was also the template for the rise-from-poverty movie. Poverty being quite a major theme of the 80s, and something that isn't very often mentioned these days. Sylvester Stallone clearly spent much of his early career envying Pacino and De Niro, and turning his films into 90-minute audition tapes for Martin Scorsese. There's a direct lineage through Taxi Driver and Raging Bull to Stallone's Rocky (and his almost-forgotten street fable Paradise Alley) and on through The Karate Kid. At each stage, though, a little of the grit gets washed off, the poverty becomes a little more bogus. What's notable, watching 80s TV and movies now, is how much more gritty and soulful they seem than today's mainstream product. You believe Ralph Macchio's just some scrawny kid; you know Jaden Smith is a gym-honed star-in-the-making.

Not that the 80s weren't obsessively body-conscious. Fitness – be it Jane Fonda's Workout video, jogging or dirty dancing – was all some people cared about. This was the decade which switched us from leisurewear to sportswear, from leather-uppers to Air Jordans. Much of the music seemed to have been created in the hopes of accompanying a sports training montage, in the knowledge that it would be pumped, bumped and thumped to in gyms across the world.

This let's-get-physical dynamic made a strange hybrid when it crossbred with 80s poverty chic. You end up with oddities like Donna Summer's She Works Hard for the Money or Simply Red's Money's Too Tight to Mention. At the time, this seemed frankly hypocritical. Rich pop stars in glossy videos asked When am I Going to Make a Living? and asserted they were living in the Love of the Common People. The question is, where has all this stuff gone? It's not that I'm expecting protest songs in the Download top 40, but there seem to be an awful lot of non-subjects, an awful lot of things which just don't matter.

As I look at it now, 80s pop culture was exactly that – a culture not a monoculture. It tolerated diversity of race, age, appearance. Clearly, the 1970s were the great age of porky, beardy, ugly blokes making great pop (Abba, ELO, 10CC) – but the 80s still allowed the ill-favoured and over-40 to have a mainstream musical presence. Back then, not all pop was made by sexbots from Planet Airbrush. I've been trying to avoid the phrase ""a more innocent age"", but what else is there to say when you compare Bananarama trogging around the stage looking like your sister's overdressed mates to Lady Gaga's latest outbreak of joyless S&M squarebashing?

True, Lady Gaga is, most people would admit, quite a character. And it's most of all in the creation of strong characters that the 80s seems to beat us hands down. Again, this may be a hangover from cinema of the 70s. Any tyro Hollywood scriptwriter will tell you that they want their plots to be character-driven. But it's high-concept movies that dominate; the pitch comes first, the players can be tacked on later. Mr Miyagi – atrocious stereotype that he is – is a character who managed to transcend the movie he was in. The same goes for The A-Team. It's Mr T's iconic-ironic status that makes the show remarkable.

Maybe it's something paradoxical that I'm starting to treasure from the 80s – the very moments when they were striving to be what we are now, but failed. There's a particular style: the clumpy editing that predated digital; the dodgy complexions that couldn't be fixed in post-production. But there's also substance: the dying lights of 60s idealism and 70s social conscience; the glimpses of a world which, if it had known what really mattered, might have been completely different.

Toby Litt's novel King Death is published by Hamish Hamilton. The A-Team is reviewed on page 10 and The Karate Kid on page 11.

This article was amended on 6 August 2010. The sentence 'Although it was to be another two years before Douglas Adams coined that particular phrase' has been deleted because the phrase, 'life, the universe and everything' had been coined before 1980.

Just the high points...

Movies, music and TV genres that the 1980s did best

Film

Father-son body swap

This micro-genre's Citizen Kane moment was in 1988, when Tom Hanks wished himself Big. Hanks was beaten to the punch, however, by Like Father Like Son the year before, with Kirk Cameron and Dudley Moore.

Indian burial ground movies

Nothing can curse a house quicker than being built over a graveyard – those vengeful spirits just won't lie still. There are only two of these that count: The Shining and Poltergeist. 1989's Pet Sematary tried the same trick, but it's just not in the same class.

Non-feminist empowerment

After a wave of 70s films showcasing fearless, brilliant women breaking the gender straitjacket, the 80s saw a major variation: step forward dim-bulb Melanie Griffith in Working Girl. But Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda et al did some heavy lifting in this area with Nine to Five (1980). Andrew Pulver

Music

Computer rock

As home computers reached awesome new powers of 48k and beyond, much music sprang up around these new machines. Kraftwerk's 1981 Computer World was the ultimate domestic microchip fetish; see also Oakey and Moroder's Together in Electric Dreams, and Gary Numan's Are 'Friends' Electric?

Songs about nuclear war

The frisson of impending apocalypse led to another new pop motif. At one end there was Frankie Goes to Hollywood's chart-topping Two Tribes; at the other, Stoke's pounding hardcore dons Discharge yelling through 1982's seriously harrowing A Hell on Earth.

Lipstick metal

Kiss and Mötley Crüe were silly enough, but the rouge-caked, backcombed, static-shock-hazard likes of Twisted Sister, Hanoi Rocks and Stryper were another level. Tom Hughes

TV

Shows about the unemployed

After the first Thatcher recession, unemployment was the 80s' big preoccupation. Boys from the Blackstuff was the decade's Big Drama, but creative responses to the lack of a proper job propped up Auf Wiedersehen Pet, Minder, and Only Fools and Horses.

TV for and about lazy students

Full grants, tenured academics and cheap bedsits conspired to make the 80s student perfect TV fodder. Their scuzzy existences were satirised in The Young Ones, and sofa-dossers were catered for by quiz show Blockbusters.

Glove puppet superstars

Basil Brush and Sooty blazed the trail, but they were kids' stuff. As Tiswas and Going Live's audiences got older, so did the puppets: Spit the Dog, Gordon the Gopher and, biggest of all, Roland Rat (left). He saved TV-am, you know. AP"

A comprehensive list of blocked words is published by China Digital Times, which keeps an extensive database. Digital censorship has pushed Chinese citizens to create an irreverent, ingenious and hilarious counter-language of puns, gifs, memes, nicknames and more, to fill in the spaces otherwise left blank. I turned to those missing words to record the events of 1989 and the aftermath.

1. The demonstrations, which daily brought up to a million people to Tiananmen Square, began when Beijing students tried to mourn the sudden death of Hu Yaobang, a reformist leader who had been removed from office.

2. The government accused the mourners of inciting rebellion, and the student movement was born. In the wake of 40 years of political turmoil that claimed the lives of at least 60 million people, the public square became not just ground zero for a democracy movement, but a space to remember the past, debate the present, and imagine the future.

3. The world was watching. When the government turned away from dialogue, 3,000 students began a hunger strike that lasted 10 days.

4. On 19 May, general secretary Zhao Ziyang visited the students in the middle of the night. He told them, “I am sorry”. The next day, the government imposed martial law and mobilised troops, and Zhao was placed under house arrest where he would remain until his death in 2005. Zhao’s children were denied permission to bury their father’s ashes until 2015.

5. On the night of 3 June and the early hours of 4 June, people took to the streets to stop the tanks from reaching the student demonstrators. Fighting took place on streets and intersections – Muxidi, Gongzhufen, Chang’an Avenue – and the People’s Liberation Army opened fire with lead bullets. The number of dead, including those crushed by tanks, remains unknown. The unprecedented and peaceful civil movement was transformed into the Beijing massacre, or what the government calls the Tiananmen Incident.

6. On the morning of 4 June 1989, a line of tanks was stopped, momentarily, by a person whose identity has never been discovered, and whose fate remains unknown.

7. On each anniversary, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, and so on, numbers of every permutation (6/4, 64, squareof8, 31May, 89 etc and even baijiu, a liquor that sounds like 89) are suppressed. The name of the former premier, Li Peng, is temporarily banned, alongside the names of victims, student leaders, workers and activists, and certain foreign media sites. Even “sensitive word” and “internet block” are disallowed. So many pages are inaccessible that 4 June is jokingly referred to by Chinese citizens as Internet Maintenance Day.

8. Every June, parents and/or spouses of the victims are placed under house arrest or removed from their homes, and forbidden from public mourning. For 27 years, Ding Zilin has been trying to grieve for her son, Jiang Jielian, who was shot by the army. She founded a group, the Tiananmen Mothers, searching for “those who shared the same fate”, and this group of elderly bereaved are known as the mothers of the motherland. Their demand was simple: the right to mourn peacefully and in public.

9. To remember, citizens post candles to commemorate the dead, they call for a silent vigil to pay respect to that day and honour the memory of that year. They ask citizens to wear black and take a walk. They call the massacre in Beijing a wound in history and remind one another to never forget these weeks that were the end of spring and the beginning of summer, a night when the empire besieged the city, and the end of an era.

10. The poet Bei Dao wrote: “Life’s only a promise / Don’t grieve for it / We knocked down midnight’s door / alone like a match polished into light.” Today, 27 years later, even the words yesterday and tomorrow are so politically charged, they disappear.

MICHAEL SAWARD

Politics without performance may be no politics at all – just routine administration and backroom deals.

Politicians have to appeal to a wide range of groups. And a good performance – one that looks good, sounds good, is convincing – can be crucial to convey that appeal.

Oscar winning actor and politician Glenda Jackson believes all the world is a stage for today’s political leaders:

GLENDA JACKSON

Obama clearly struck a chord, not only in America, but around the world.I mean that was something that people had been wanting to hear for a very, very long time - the capacity, the ability to connect .And to connect with individuals, even though those individuals are standing in crowds of hundreds of thousands.

MICHAEL SAWARD

We expect our politicians to perform well - even if we complain about the fact that they may sometimes be 'acting'. There’s a huge pressure on politicians to be good performers. And, as author Pauline Melville explained to Evan Davies on Radio Four’s Today programme recently, there’s a long history of politicians being trained.

Margaret Thatcher had voice lessons… People can be taught to mirror their clients’ body language, to look empathetic or to have power walking.

EVAN DAVIS

Power walking?

PAULINE MELVILLE

Yes, walk with confidence to present themselves with confidence. Actually that reminds me of seeing Blair and Bush power walking towards the podium to talk about the Iraq War. You know you wonder if they’d learned…

EVAN DAVIS

They’d been taught how to power walk?

PAULINE MELVILLE

Yes.

MICHAEL SAWARD

All this effort put into performing well may reflect the fact that images are now so powerful in our culture now that acting establishes what counts as 'real'.

Parliamentary Sketch writer and theatre critic Quentin Letts:

QUENTIN LETTS

The greatest example of acting British politics in the last 100 years or so, Winston Churchill.

Those speeches during the war, Britain was really up against it, we were not winning the war at the time, and yet Churchill presented this bulldog character which was very much at odds with his personal character -- he was a drunk, he was a … he was a difficult tortured, complex man, and yet he presented this image of the bulldog.

And that was a wonderful bit of acting; and that was an example about how acting could really help the national cause. So, you know, it’s too glib just to say 'acting is bad in politics'. Acting can be essential.

MICHAEL SAWARD

So acting in politics is not lying – it might be, sometimes, but the connection is not that common, and certainly it’s not automatic.

Politicians have to gather information on issues and to negotiate competing values. They can’t do these things if they are totally open about what they think at all times. Not being precise, or not giving everything away at once, is not lying – it is just being careful, being 'politic', often for good reasons.

This is not an easy role, and putting on a good performance, one conveying sincerity and authenticity, is crucial to success.

Sometimes 'lying' is not knowing. Or not knowing enough; sometimes it is strategic openness to the future.

Sometimes, of course, truth, lies and performance are connected. Performances that try to gloss over or avoid truths are common enough.

And who can blame politicians- if they get caught out it can be embarrassing to say the least.

I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. I misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that.

MICHAEL SAWARD

President Bill Clinton finally admitting an affair with Monica Lewinsky.

In a democracy, politics has to be seen to be done. It has to be performed, staged, scripted. If it wasn’t, as citizens, we might not have a clue what’s going on.

Democracy needs effective engagement and communication. Quentin Letts:

QUENTIN LETTS

Well I think the problem with this whole issue is that we, the voters, are terrible hypocrites.

We say we don’t like actors in our politics, and yet, when the politicians don’t act, they don’t get so many votes.

So we as an electorate have to sort out our attitude to this. And I think the honest answer is that they need to do a bit of acting - but they probably have been overdoing it recently.

MICHAEL SAWARD

Performances create democratic politics. Performances create audiences – citizens who pay attention. But can’t we have authentic leaders? What is authentic? We shouldn’t confuse truthful content with an authentic person.

Authentic can mean a strong sense that they are genuinely grappling with the issues – even if they are 'acting', and even if they are not yet telling us everything.

There is always the frontstage politician on show for the media and the backstage one. Do we really want to collapse the two?

Quentin Letts thinks that sometimes being a good performer will never be enough.

QUENTIN LETTS

If you get the policy right, then you’ve got to find the personality and the promotional skills to punt it up field. So you’ve got to have the base camp of the policy and you’ve got to have worked out your philosophy.

A great performance without that policy is absolutely pointless.

Paddy Ashdown was in some respects a really good performer, politically. He was good at sound bites; he looked good; ex-Army man, he had a great back story; had hopeless policies and it was never going to work.

MICHAEL SAWARD

Perhaps as voters we’re accepting stage managed politics and we want good, justified performances. Glenda Jackson agrees.

GLENDA JACKSON

I do sometimes sit and fulminate when I’m watching either PMQs or questions to Ministers, MPs stand up and they haven’t rehearsed their question, and there’s a kind of lot of humming and ahhing and taking ages to get to the point.

MICHAEL SAWARD

So what is a citizen to do? Quentin Letts thinks we the voters should become critics of the political theatre.

QUENTIN LETTS

We’re now pretty sophisticated about the way that we look at politics.

If we look at a TV debate, we know that they’ve all been prepping like made; we know that they’re trying not to make a mistake.

If we look at political events on television, we know that there is a certain amount of fraudery involved, and yet we somehow discount that and we buy into it because we realise that they’ve got to have some way of establishing their platform.

MICHAEL SAWARD

As citizens we need to judge those political performances that are timely and justified, and those that are not.It’s not about getting upset because politicians act.It’s about how justified that act is, and who and what it is aimed at.

Much of the pioneering thinking on Thatcherism can be found in the work of Stuart Hall.
When remembering Thatcherism it is important to consider the wide cultural impact, and not only the introduction of market ideas into areas of life that were previously regarded as safe from laissez-faire principles.
Thatcherism has left its ‘ideological’ mark also on higher education.","ideological, thatcher, hall, thinking, ideas, political, thatcherism, remembering, market, education, right","Margaret Thatcher at Chequers in 1993 The response to the death of Mrs Thatcher has provoked many reactions. There is much nostalgia in some of these recollections, whether invoked by her imperial adventures in the South Atlantic or stoic opposition to European bureaucrats, and inevitably complex questions have been reduced to simple messages.

However, historical memory itself is a politically contested area and this has been made very clear in Thatcher’s case. Gushing tributes from Tory and New Labour politicians have been accompanied by street parties in Glasgow, Liverpool and Brixton.

How we remember Thatcher and Thatcherism will have a bearing on contemporary politics.

There has been much respect across the political spectrum, for her as a ‘conviction’ politician. This is partly a reflection on the limitations of the modern politician, now constrained more than ever by soundbites and spindoctors, and who operate in a less ideologically polarised age.

But Thatcher – and in particular Thatcherism – has a much more profound meaning. That there is an ‘ism’ implies a set of distinctive ideas and beliefs, a critique of the world as it exists and a vision of how things need to change. For example, few talk of ‘Blairism’; and if they do, they normally refer to questions of style and presentation.

This ideological nature of Thatcherism helps us understand wider changes in Britain in recent decades and shifts which have taken place across politics, economics and culture. Much of the pioneering thinking on Thatcherism can be found in the work of Stuart Hall. His first article The Great Moving Right Show, written before Thatcher came to power and while Hall was still at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, was a prescient analysis of the ‘swing to the right’ that was taking place in British society.

In this article, Hall outlined the way in which Thatcher and the radical right had put together a critique of the post-war social democratic consensus and were attempting to construct a new consensus drawn from some of the ‘common sense’ hopes and fears of ordinary people and based around the idea of a free market and a strong state. He called this drift to the right; ‘authoritarian populism’

Hall’s analysis was informed by the ideas of the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci. This included the importance Gramsci attributed to periods of ‘organic crisis’, where the existing ideological framework and assumptions, political settlements and economic rationale, no longer convinced and were brought into question.

According to Gramsci, organic crises, which ‘may last for decades’, were moments in politics when the ‘old is dying but the new is still to be born’. According to Hall, Britain from the mid-1970s onwards was in such a crisis. Thatcher understood this and in particular that the Keynesian-social democratic consensus was breaking down and that in order to take full advantage of this the Conservative Party also had to change to embrace free market economic ideas and more authoritarian social policies.

In further articles in Marxism Today and elsewhere, Hall, who joined The Open University as Professor of Sociology the same year Mrs Thatcher took office, applied another Gramscian concept: hegemony. Thatcherism, he argued, was a ‘hegemonic’ project which had won an ideological battle and was in the process of constructing a new consensus. He also argued that the left had failed to understand the nature of the crisis and had no alternative.

In making this case, Thatcherite ideology drew on the work of Milton Friedman and applied his free market thinking to the specific situation in Britain. This kind of individualism represented a ‘qualitative’ shift in the political agenda of the Conservative Party, now defined as the ‘radical right’.

In this way Thatcher, supported by several New Right think tanks, including the Institute of Economic Affairs, the Centre for Policy Studies and the Adam Smith Institute, was able to claim that Labour’s welfare and social agenda was denying freedom to individuals, encouraging ‘dependency’ and, combined with trade union power, was responsible for Britain’s economic ruin.

They argued that Keynesianism, which had partly informed Conservative as well as Labour governments in the past, had failed and needed to be replaced by Monetarist thinking. Large-scale privatisation of what classical conservatives regarded as the ‘family silver’ was to follow.

When remembering Thatcherism it is important to consider the wide cultural impact, and not only the introduction of market ideas into areas of life that were previously regarded as safe from laissez-faire principles.

It stimulated a major response in drama, literature and music and some of the most innovative critics of Thatcherism were artists of various kinds. Thatcherism, almost uniquely, encouraged its own genres in response, whether in the dramas of Alan Bleasdale, the films of Mike Leigh or the music of Billy Bragg. In recent days, suggestions of a Thatcher soundtrack have even been proposed.

Thatcherism’s legacy has lived on in many ways. New Labour politicians have openly acknowledged their debts to Thatcherite thinking on the economy and trade union reforms. With the current political situation in mind, critics have also pointed out the close parallels between the languages of welfare and poverty in the 1980s and current government agendas.

Thatcherism has left its ‘ideological’ mark also on higher education. In the early 1980s, Education Minister Keith Joseph, together with some of his officials in the Department of Education, reportedly went through some Open University courses in search of Marxist bias.

Hopefully they found something to stimulate their interest. The Higher Education agenda, with its current focus on ‘employability’ and ‘customers’, could be one area, at least, where Thatcherism can be said to have won – for now anyway."

At least 100 people have died after USA planes bombed targets in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and the Benghazi region.

Around 66 American jets, some of them flying from British bases launched an attack at around 0100hrs on Monday.

The White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, has said that the strike was directed at key military sites but reports suggest that missiles also hit Bin Ashur, a densely populated suburb in the capital.

Colonel Muamar Gaddafi residential compound took a direct hit that killed Hanna Gaddafi, the adopted baby daughter of the Libyan leader.

President Reagan has justified the attacks by accusing Libya of direct responsibility for terrorism aimed at America, such as the bombing of La Belle discoteque in West Berlin 10 days ago.

Self Defence

President Reagan made a TV address to the American people two hours after the attack.

In it he said : ""When our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes, we will respond so long as I'm in this office.""

He argued that America was exercising its right to self defence as defined by Article 51 of the UN charter.

The presidential spokesman, Larry Speakes, said, ""US forces have executed a series of carefully planned air strikes against terrorist targets in Libya.""

He added: ""Every effort has been made to avoid hitting civilian targets.""

The attacks began soon after an increase in coded radio traffic between US ships and planes off the Libyan coast had been noticed.

The fighter jets appear to have been both carrier based aircraft, operating in the Mediterranean and British based bombers which would have refuelled in mid air.

The Americans hit the harbour's naval academy, the capital's military airport and army barracks.

Tripoli's embassy area and residential districts also suffered extensive damage.

The Tripoli central hospital and two other medical centres say they have treated hundreds of injured people, including a number of Greeks, Italians and Yugoslavs.

Mobs of angry survivors have taken to the streets shouting: ""Down, down USA. Death to all Americans.""

There are also fears that Britain may be subject to terrorist attacks because some of its involvement in the raids.

The Syrian based terrorist group, Arab Revolutionary Cells, has announced on Lebanese radio that it will target both British and American interests."

The poster has been hung, in part, to mark 25 years since the Velvet Revolution, or as it is known to Slovaks, the Gentle Revolution.

At the time, Czechoslovak citizens congregated on the square to jangle their keys and express their support for change. They were ready to end communist rule and move towards democracy.

The authorities had responded violently to a student demonstration on November 17 1989 so Havel and other intellectual dissidents had helped mobilise a series of peaceful protests in response. Within ten days, they succeeded in overthrowing one of Eastern Europe’s most repressive communist dictatorships. The clarion call was “Havel na Hrad” (Havel to the castle as president).

Half full and a quarter empty

Twenty-five years on, views on the events of 1989 are mixed. Polls from Czech research institute CVVM and Slovakia’s IVO reveal only 61% of Czechs and 51% of Slovaks view the events of that autumn in a positive light. What’s more, 12% of Czechs and 18% of Slovaks express unambiguously negative views of the end of communism.

The magnitude of the achievements of Czechs and the Slovaks in the past quarter of a century should not be underestimated. The post-communist challenge of democratisation, marketisation, state-building after the break-up of Czechoslovakia and integration into Western structures such as NATO and the EU were hard enough. Then these small export-orientated economies have had to cope with the credit crunch and the woes of the eurozone crisis too.

In many respects, the Czech and Slovak Republics seem better placed than some fellow EU member states in Western Europe to cope with the challenges of the 21st century. Citizens overwhelmingly value the freedoms brought by the end of communism. They enjoy open access to information, the ability to express their opinions and the opportunities to work, study and travel abroad that were not possible before the revolution. But ask them about social values, crime and employment and their answers are very different.

There is a certain discontent that stems from a sense that the promises and aspirations expressed during the heady days of November 1989 have only partially been delivered. Some citizens – especially the less virtuous ones – have benefited considerably more than others. It is difficult not to turn on the TV news or open a newspaper in either country without being regaled with the juicy details of the latest corruption scandal. Politicians and businessmen have been able to use their connections – some of which were forged in communist times – to strike lucrative deals that pay well for them but less well for the state.

And perhaps the most striking finding of the CVVM/IVO research is that Czechs, and particularly Slovaks, see little or no improvement in terms of equality before the law. This suggests a strong sense of disenchantment with the post-communist judicial and legal system.

Party politics

The disillusionment with politicians has fuelled support for a steady succession of new parties. In the 2010 Czech elections, for instance, a new party called Public Affairs called for an end to “political dinosaurs”. The message struck a chord with voters and the party was propelled into a coalition government. The victory was short lived though, as Public Affairs crumbled under the weight of its own corruption scandals.

Then in the 2013 elections, another new party with an anti-corruption appeal performed well enough to secure prominent portfolios in government. The ANO is founded and led by the billionaire businessmen Andrej Babis, who is now deputy prime minister of the Czech Republic. His party seeks to appeal to voters not just by opposing corruption but by pushing the cult of the expert.

Babis is an attractive option because he has demonstrated his ability to succeed in business after 1989 and might, therefore, be seen as more capable of running the country more effectively than a career politician. But Babis faced years of criticism over allegations that he acted as a security agent for the Communist regime. And while he eventually cleared his name, his struggle acts as a reminder that while 1989 may have marked a change, the slate was not wiped entirely clean.

In 1989, Havel proclaimed that “truth and love must triumph over lies and hatred”. A generation later, for both Czechs and Slovaks, truth and love appear to have gained the upper ground. Lies and hatred remain though – and perhaps more significantly disillusionment persists.

Havel’s image on the front of the National Museum will not be there forever, but the health and quality of democracy in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are dependent on a new generation of citizens willing to fight for the truth and love that formed the basis of his protest back in 1989."

For satire, circumstance is all. The obvious disintegration of a ruling order heralded Beyond the Fringe, on stage from 1960, Private Eye, in print from 1961, and That was The Week That Was, on screen from 1962. TW3, as it was known, lampooned the political class in general and the Conservative government in particular. On the principle that it took one to know one, Oxbridge graduates could perhaps most tellingly challenge the establishment.

The most prominent figure in the scene was Peter Cook, who appointed Roger Law as the resident artist at his Establishment Club. Law also drew for Private Eye, and soon progressed from one to three dimensions in the form of Plasticine caricature, working with cartoonist and caricaturist Peter Fluck. The pair created models – including Richard Nixon – which adorned many publications, as well as book – and even LP – covers.

It was a curious limitation of the form that those models were only viewed as photographs. The next stage would be animation. It was another curiosity that the increasingly scabrous satirical culture of the 1960s and 1970s had not produced a focused satirical TV programme – as distinct from a comedy show within which satirical elements featured. Circumstance transpired to resolve both.

Thatcher’s Britain

In 1981 – in a Britain of mass unemployment, urban rioting, an unpopular prime minister and her programme of deindustrialisation, and a ruinously divided opposition – the graphic designer Martin Lambie-Nair lunched with Fluck and Law and suggested that a puppet satire TV show should be pitched to independent television. The pilot, in June 1983, coincided with Margaret Thatcher’s landslide second election victory.

Central Television commissioned a full series which began the following year, produced, as was much else in 1980s British television comedy, by John Lloyd. After two years 15m people were watching.

With Spitting Image Productions achieving an annual turnover of £2m, Luck and Flaw, as they styled themselves, built a studio at Canary Wharf, in the heart of the iconic Thatcherite development of London’s Docklands precinct. Satirical entrepreneurs, Fluck and Law franchised the series around the world, and the fullest entrepreneurial expression of their art came with their range of squeaky dog toys.

Much in the manner of Monty Python, Spitting Image also diversified into books and music – the Chicken Song, a lampoon of holiday disco earworms, acquired a defictionalised ubiquity all of its own, reaching number one in the charts and being played throughout the summer of 1986.

Why aren’t I in it?

As it had been in 1960, much of the appeal was in the breaking of taboos. For reasons of protocol, genuflection, and the Lord Chamberlain, the monarch had rarely if ever been depicted on stage, in print, or on screen, in anything but reverential terms. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was from the outset one of the stars of Spitting Image, although, cognisant perhaps of public attitudes, the royal caricatures were mild of flavour.

Politicians were the main target. But – as is always the case – rather than being offended they were more concerned if they were overlooked by the show. Just as many had always sought to purchase the newspaper cartoons that lampooned them, so many professed to enjoy their latex manifestation, not least when it served to reinforce their political persona. And, in many cases, Spitting Image’s grotesque puppets established the way they were widely seen by the public. As for Thatcher – dining with ministers in a restaurant, she orders (raw) steak for herself and, when asked about the vegetables, she replied: “They’ll have the same as me.”

One of my cherished schoolboy memories includes the puppet of Janet Street-Porter which was itself so sidesplitting it was not possible – in those pre-streaming days – to hear what it was supposed to be saying, not to mention Jeffrey Archer merrily tapping out his next opus on a typewriter with four keys: C, R, A, and P.

Quality, in a weekly TV satire, was inevitably variable, but one highlight that sticks out was the 1987 general election special, which concluded with a re-enactment of the climax of Cabaret: a fresh-faced member of the Thatcher youth race sings Tomorrow Belongs to Me, before the leaderene whispers to the viewer “tomorrow belongs to ME.” It did.

As the Conservative government limped towards its end, so too did Spitting Image. Viewing figures fell such that the 18th series in 1996 was the last, too early for the New Labour government, though not too late for there to be a beaming model of a then-unsullied Tony Blair.

Given its roots, it is eminently appropriate for the Spitting Image archive to be given to Cambridge University, but also for it to be thought of as part of history. Law is now a ceramicist in Norfolk, Fluck an artist in Cornwall. Suggestions of reviving the show have not accompanied this flurry of interest – circumstance being all, British politics and public life in 2018 defies satire."

Material is added to this site on a regular basis - information on this page may change Summary The hunger strikes transformed the political context of the Northern Ireland problem. Now, republican prisoners appeared in the unwonted role of being prepared to accept suffering for their cause rather than simply inflicting suffering on its behalf. The mass turnouts at the prisoners' funderals revealed that the standing of the prisoners in Catholic areas had risen dramatically and this was soon reflected in a novel development, an impressive Sinn Féin electoral intervention. By June 1983 Sinn Féin had obtained some 13.4% of the vote in the North which compared well with the SDLP's 17.9%.

Bew and Gillespie (1993) Northern Ireland A Chronology of the Troubles 1968-1993

Bobby Sands, then leader of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in the Maze Prison, refused food on 1 March 1981 and so began a new hunger strike. The choice of the date was significant because it marked the fifth anniversary of the ending of special category status (1 March 1976). The main aim of the new strike was to achieve the reintroduction of 'political' status for Republican prisoners. Special category, or 'political', status would be achieved if five demands were met: the right of prisoners to wear their civilian clothes at all times; the right to free association within a block of cells; the right not to do prison work; the right to educational and recreational facilities; and the restoration of lost remission of sentence. It later became clear that the IRA leadership outside the prison was not in favour of a new hunger strike following the outcome of the 1980 strike. The main impetus for a new protest came from the prisoners themselves. The strike was to last until 3 October 1981 and was to see 10 Republican prisoners starve themselves to death in support of their demands.

The tactic of the hunger strike has a special place in Republican history and has proved very emotive for Nationalists in Ireland throughout the 20th century. The impact that could be achieved on world opinion was clear in 1920 when Terence MacSwiney, then Lord Mayor of Cork, died in Brixton Prison, London, on day 74 of his hunger strike. A passage from a speech he had made at his inauguration as Lord Mayor was to be recalled during the 1981 hunger strike: ""It is not those who can inflict the most, but those who can suffer the most who will conquer"".

Just how much impact the 1981 strike was having on the Nationalist population of Ireland became clear when Bobby Sands was elected a Member of Parliament (MP) during a by-election for the Fermanagh / South Tyrone seat and two other hunger strikers were elected as Teachta Dáil (TDs) in a general election in the Republic of Ireland.

The hunger strike ended on 3 October 1981 when those Republican prisoners who had still been refusing food decided to end their hunger strike. At this stage in the protest six prisoners were on hunger strike. The main reason for the ending of the strike was the realisation that each of the families of the strikers would ask for medical intervention whenever the strikers lapsed into unconsciousness. On 6 October 1981 James Prior, then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, announced a series of measures which went a long way to meeting many aspects of the prisoners' five demands.

The hunger strike of 1981 had very important and far-reaching consequences for Northern Ireland and proved to be one of the key turning points of 'the Troubles'. The Republican movement had achieved a huge propaganda victory over the British government and had obtained a lot of international sympathy. Active and tacit support for the Irish Republican Army (IRA) increased in Nationalist areas. Political support for Sinn Féin (SF) was demonstrated in two by-elections (and the general election in the Republic of Ireland) and eventually led to the emergence of SF as a significant political force in Northern Ireland. The British government's fear that SF would overtake the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as the main representative of the Catholic population of Northern Ireland was a key reason for the government signing the Anglo-Irish Agreement (AIA) on 15 November 1985."

They took the authorities by surprise and set the tone for a most audacious and lengthy protest that lasted 19years. Within 6 months the camp became known as the Women’s Peace Camp and gained recognition both nationally and internationally by drawing attention to the base with well publicised imaginitive gatherings.This unique initiative threw a spotlight on ‘Cruise’ making it a national and international political issue throughout the 80s and early 90s. The presence of women living outside an operational nuclear base 24 hours a day, brought a new perspective to the peace movement - giving it leadership and a continuous focus. At a time when the USA and the USSR were competing for nuclear superiority in Europe, the Women’s Peace Camp on Greenham Common was seen as an edifying influence. The commitment to non-violence and non-alignment gave the protest an authority that was difficult to dismiss – journalists from almost every corner of the globe found their way to the camp and reported on the happenings and events taking place there. Living conditions were primitive. Living outside in all kinds of weather especially in the winter and rainy seasons was testing. Without electricity, telephone, running water etc, frequent evictions and vigilante attacks, life was difficult. In spite of the conditions women, from many parts of the UK and abroad, came to spend time at the camp to be part of the resistance to nuclear weapons. It was a case of giving up comfort for commitment. The protest, committed to disrupting the exercises of the USAF, was highly effective. Nuclear convoys leaving the base to practice nuclear war, were blockaded, tracked to their practice area and disrupted.Taking non-violent direct action meant that women were arrested, taken to court and sent to prison. The conduct and integrity of the protest mounted by the Women’s Peace Camp was instrumental in the decision to remove the Cruise Missiles from Greenham Common. Under the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, the missiles were flown back to the USA along with the USAF personnel in 91/92. The Treaty signed by the USA and the USSR in 1987, is in accord with the stated position held by women, in defence of their actions on arrest, when it states : “Conscious that nuclear weapons would have devastating consequences for all mankind” A number of initiatives were made by women in Court testing the legality of nuclear weapons. Also, challenges to the conduct and stewardship of the Ministry of Defence as landlords of Greenham Common. In 1992 Lord Taylor, Lord Chief Justice, delivering the Richard Dimbleby Lecture for the BBC, referring to the Bylaws case ( won by Greenham women in the House of Lords in 1990) said ‘…it would be difficult to suggest a group whose cause and lifestyle were less likely to excite the sympathies and approval of five elderly judges. Yet it was five Law Lords who allowed the Appeal and held that the Minister had exceeded his powers in framing the byelaws so as to prevent access to common land’.

A cloud of fire engulfed the space shuttle just 73 seconds after liftoff, at an altitude of some 46,000 feet (14,000 meters). It looked like an explosion, the media called it an explosion and even NASA officials mistakenly described it that way initially. But later investigation showed that in fact, there was no detonation or explosion in the way we commonly understand the concept.

A seal in the shuttle’s right solid-fuel rocket booster designed to prevent leaks during liftoff weakened in the frigid temperatures and failed, and hot gas began pouring through the leak. The fuel tank itself collapsed and tore apart, and the resulting flood of liquid oxygen and hydrogen created the huge fireball believed by many to be an explosion.

Challenger Explosion

2. The astronauts aboard the shuttle didn’t die instantly.

A seal in the shuttle’s right solid-fuel rocket booster designed to prevent leaks from the fuel tank during liftoff weakened in the frigid temperatures and failed, and hot gas began pouring through the leak. The fuel tank itself collapsed and tore apart, and the resulting flood of liquid oxygen and hydrogen created the huge fireball believed by many to be an explosion.

After the collapse of its fuel tank, the Challenger itself remained momentarily intact and actually continued moving upwards. Without its fuel tank and boosters beneath it, however, powerful aerodynamic forces soon pulled the orbiter apart. The pieces—including the crew cabin—reached an altitude of some 65,000 feet before falling out of the sky into the Atlantic Ocean below.

It’s likely that the Challenger’s crew survived the initial breakup of the shuttle but lost consciousness due to loss of cabin pressure and probably died due to oxygen deficiency pretty quickly. But the cabin hit the water’s surface (at more than 200 mph) a full 2 minutes and 45 seconds after the shuttle broke apart, and it’s unknown whether any of the crew could have regained consciousness in the final few seconds of the fall.

3. Relatively few people actually saw the Challenger disaster unfold on live television.

Though popular wisdom about the 30-year-old tragedy holds that millions of people watched the Challenger’s horrific fate unfold live on television—in addition to the hundreds watching on the ground—the fact is that most people watched taped replays of the actual event.

All major networks carrying the launch cut away when the shuttle broke apart, and the tragedy occurred at a time (11:39 a.m. Eastern Time on a Tuesday) when most people were in school or at work. CNN broadcast the launch in its entirety, but cable news was a relatively new phenomenon at the time, and even fewer people had satellite dishes.

Though the general public may not have been watching live, NASA had arranged a satellite broadcast onto TV sets in many schools because of McAuliffe’s role in the mission, and many of the schoolchildren who watched remember the disaster as a pivotal moment in their childhoods.

4. Some suggested that the White House pushed NASA to launch the shuttle in time for President Ronald Reagan’s State of the Union address

NASA officials apparently felt intense pressure to push the Challenger’s mission forward after repeated delays, partially due to difficulties getting the previous shuttle, Columbia, back on the ground. But the rumors that pressure was exerted from above, specifically from the Reagan White House, in order to connect the shuttle or its astronauts directly in some way with the State of the Union seem to have been politically motivated and not based on any direct evidence.

In the aftermath of the tragedy, Reagan postponed his annual message to the nation (the first, and so far only, time in history a president has done so) and addressed the nation about the Challenger instead. Widely regarded as one of the best speeches of his presidency, the 650-word address ended with a moving quote from the poem “High Flight,” by the American pilot John McGee Jr., who was killed while flying for the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War II.

Of the Challenger astronauts, Reagan said: “We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and ‘slipped the surly bonds of earth’ to ‘touch the face of God.’”

Did the US Go to the Moon to Beat the Soviets?

5. More than a decade after the Challenger disaster, two large pieces from the spacecraft washed ashore at a local beach.

Within a day of the shuttle tragedy, salvage operations recovered hundreds of pounds of metal from the Challenger. In March 1986, the remains of the astronauts were found in the debris of the crew cabin. Though all of the important pieces of the shuttle were retrieved by the time NASA closed its Challenger investigation in 1986, most of the spacecraft remained in the Atlantic Ocean.

A decade later, memories of the disaster resurfaced when two large pieces of the Challenger washed up in the surf at Cocoa Beach, 20 miles south of the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. NASA believed the two barnacle-encrusted fragments, one measuring more than 6 feet wide and 13 feet long, were originally connected, and that they came from the shuttle’s left wing flap.

After being verified, the newly found parts were placed in two abandoned missile silos with the other shuttle remains, which number around 5,000 pieces and weigh in at some 250,000 pounds."

The controversial deal—and the ensuing political scandal—threatened to bring down the presidency of Ronald Reagan.

Reagan Doctrine

The Iran-Contra Affair, also known as “The Iran-Contra Scandal” and “Irangate,” may not have happened were it not for the political climate in the early 1980s.

President Ronald Reagan, who won the White House in 1980, wasn’t able to maintain the political momentum for his Republican colleagues, and the GOP was swept from the majority in both the Senate and House of Representatives in the 1982 mid-term elections.

The results would complicate the president’s agenda. During his campaign for the White House, Reagan had promised to assist anti-Communist insurgencies around the globe, but the so-called “Reagan Doctrine” faced a political hurdle following those mid-term elections.

Sandinistas in Nicaragua

Soon after taking control of Congress, the Democrats passed the Boland Amendment, which restricted the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Department of Defense (DoD) in foreign conflicts.

The amendment was specifically aimed at Nicaragua, where anti-communist Contras were battling the communist Sandinista government.

Reagan had described the Contras as “the moral equivalent of the Founding Fathers.” But much of their funding, to that point, had come via Nicaragua’s cocaine trade, hence Congress’ decision to pass the Boland Amendment.

Still, the president instructed his National Security Advisor, Robert McFarlane, to find a way to assist the drug-dealing Contras, regardless of the cost—political or otherwise.

Iran Hostage Crisis

Meanwhile, in the Middle East, where U.S. relations with many nations were strained to the breaking point, two regional powers—Iraq and Iran—were engaged in a bloody conflict.

At the same time, Iranian-backed terrorists in Hezbollah were holding hostage seven Americans (diplomats and private contractors) in Lebanon. Reagan delivered another ultimatum to his advisors: Find a way to bring those hostages home.

In 1985, McFarlane sought to do just that. He told Reagan that Iran had approached the United States about purchasing weapons for its war against neighboring Iraq.

There was, however, a U.S. trade embargo with Iran at the time, dating back to that country’s revolution and subsequent overthrow of Shah Pahlavi of Iran, during which 52 American hostages were held for 444 days in a diplomatic standoff known as the Iran Hostage Crisis.

Although several members of Reagan’s administration opposed it—including Secretary of State George Schultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger—McFarlane argued that an arms deal with Iran would not only secure the release of the hostages, but help the United States improve relations with Lebanon, providing the country with an ally in a region where it desperately needed one.

And, as an aside, the arms deal would secure funds that the CIA could secretly funnel to the Contra insurgency in Nicaragua. With the backing of McFarlane and CIA Director William Casey, Reagan pushed ahead with the trade, over the objections of Weinberger and Schultz.

Oliver North

Lebanese newspaper Al-Shiraa first reported the arms deal between the United States and Iran in 1986, well into Reagan’s second term.

By that time, 1,500 American missiles had been sold to Iran, for $30 million. Three of the seven hostages in Lebanon were also released, although the Iran-backed terrorist group there later took three more Americans hostage.

Reagan initially denied that he had negotiated with Iran or the terrorists, only to retract the statement a week later.

Meanwhile, Attorney General Edwin Meese launched an investigation into the weapons deal, and found that some $18 million of the $30 million Iran had paid for the weapons was unaccounted for.

It was then that Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, of the National Security Council, came forward to acknowledge that he had diverted the missing funds to the Contras in Nicaragua, who used them to acquire weapons.

North said he had done so with the full knowledge of National Security Advisor Admiral John Poindexter. He assumed Reagan was also aware of his efforts.

Tower Commission

The American press hounded Reagan over the matter for the rest of his presidency. The Tower Commission (led by Texas Senator John Tower), which the president himself appointed, investigated the administration’s involvement and concluded that Reagan’s lack of oversight enabled those working under him to divert the funds to the Contras.

During a subsequent Congressional investigation, in 1987, protagonists in the scandal—including Reagan—testified before the commission in hearings that were televised nationally.

Later, Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh launched an eight-year investigation into what by then had become known as the Iran-Contra Affair. In all, 14 people were charged, including North, Poindexter and McFarlane.

Iran-Contra Scandal Fallout

Reagan himself was never charged, and, in 1992, George H. W. Bush, Reagan’s vice president who was elected president in 1988, preemptively pardoned Weinberger.

McFarlane was charged with four counts of withholding information from Congress, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to two years’ probation and $20,000 in fines.

North was charged with 12 counts relating to conspiracy and making false statements. Although he was convicted in his initial trial, the case was dismissed on appeal, due to a technicality, and North has since worked as a conservative author, critic, television host and head of the NRA.

Poindexter was initially indicted on seven felonies and ultimately tried on five. He was found guilty on four of the charges and sentenced to two years in prison, although his convictions were later vacated.

In addition, four CIA officers and five government contractors were also prosecuted; although all were found guilty of charges ranging from conspiracy to perjury to fraud, only one—private contractor Thomas Clines—ultimately served time in prison.

Reagan and Iran Contra

Despite the fact that Reagan had promised voters he would never negotiate with terrorists—which he or his underlings did while brokering the weapons sales with Iran—the two-term occupant of the White House left office as a popular president.

In interviews years later, Walsh, the special counsel tasked with investigating the Iran-Contra scandal, said that Reagan’s “instincts for the country’s good were right,” and implied that the president may have had difficulty remembering specifics of the scandal, due to failing health.

Reagan himself acknowledged that selling arms to Iran was a “mistake” during his testimony before Congress. However, his legacy, at least among his supporters, remains intact—and the Iran-Contra Affair has been relegated to an often-overlooked chapter in U.S. history.

Fueled by territorial, religious and political disputes between the two nations, the conflict ended in an effective stalemate and a cease-fire nearly eight years later, after more than half a million soldiers and civilians had been killed.

Background to the Iran-Iraq War

Tensions between Iran and Iraq began almost immediately after the establishment of the latter nation in 1921, in the aftermath of World War I. By the 1970s, one enduring source of conflict involved control of the Shatt al-Arab, the waterway formed by the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, the southern end of which forms the border between the two nations. Signed in 1975, the Algiers Agreement reduced Iraqi control over the waterway in exchange for Iran’s withdrawing support for a Kurdish insurgency in northern Iraq.

A turning point occurred with the Iranian Revolution of 1978-79, which toppled the pro-Western government of Shah Mohammad Reza Pallavi in favor of a fundamentalist regime led by Shi’ite Muslim cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Saddam Hussein, who became president of Iraq and leader of the country’s Ba'ath Party in July 1979, counted on the support of his nation’s minority Sunni Muslim population, and feared an expansion of Iran’s revolution to Shi’ite-dominated Iraq. Saddam also sought to overturn the border agreements of 1975 and reassert control over both sides of the Shatt al-Arab, Iraq’s only access point to the Persian Gulf.

Iran-Iraq War

Iraqi Invasion of Iran

Mindful of Iran’s weakened military in the wake of its revolution, Saddam decided on a preemptive strike against Iran. On September 22, 1980, Iraqi forces launched air strikes on Iranian air bases, following up with a ground invasion of the oil-producing border region of Khuzestan. The invasion was initially successful, with Iraq capturing the city of Khorramshahr and making other territorial gains by November.

But the Iraqi advance soon stalled in the face of a stiff Iranian resistance, powered by the addition of revolutionary militia to the regular armed forces. In 1981, Iran launched a counteroffensive; by early 1982, they had regained virtually all of the lost territory. By the end of that year, with Iraqi forces withdrawn to pre-war border lines, Iraq attempted to seek peace. Under Khomeini’s leadership, Iran refused, insisting on continuing the conflict in an effort to topple Saddam’s regime. In July 1982, Iran invaded Iraqi territory in an unsuccessful attempt— the first of many—to gain control of the Iraqi port city of Basra.

A Protracted Conflict

With Iran now on the offensive, Iraqi defenses solidified, and the war settled into a virtual stalemate along a front running roughly along the border. Both sides launched air and missile attacks against cities, military sites and oil facilities and transports, prompting the United States and other Western powers to send warships to the Persian Gulf to regulate the output of oil to the global market.

While Iran enjoyed a large numerical advantage, Iraq had more sophisticated weaponry and a better-trained officer corps, thanks to direct support from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Arab states and tacit support from Western nations including the United States.

In the aftermath of the 1979-81 hostage crisis involving diplomats at the U.S. embassy at Tehran, Khomeini’s regime remained largely isolated from the international community; Iran’s only allies during the conflict were Syria and Libya. Iraq continued to seek peace, but drew outrage from the international community for its use of chemical weapons against Iranian troops as well as Kurdish civilians in Iraq, who were thought to be sympathetic to Iran.

Ceasefire, Peace Agreement and Legacy

In the spring of 1988, with Iran demoralized by its many failed offensives over the years, Iraq launched its own series of ground attacks. Iraqi battlefield gains convinced Iran’s clerical leaders they had little hope of decisive victory. That July, the two nations agreed to accept a United Nations-brokered ceasefire under Security Council Resolution 598; the war ended formally on August 20, 1988. Though total casualty figures in the Iran-Iraq War are uncertain, estimates range from 1 to 2 million, with the total number killed reaching an estimated 500,000, including tens of thousands of Kurds killed by Iraqi forces.

As nearly all Arab nations had supported Iraq during the war in order to contain Iran, Iraq emerged from the conflict with more power in the region than it had before, fueled by a strengthened military and the ruthless ambition of its leader. On August 2, 1990, Saddam ordered the invasion of Kuwait, beginning the first Persian Gulf War.

For some, the 1960s and 1970s had been a troubling time that undermined Americans’ confidence in their fellow citizens and in their government. The 1980s, often remembered for its materialism and consumerism, also saw the rise of the ""yuppie,"" an explosion of blockbuster movies and the emergence of cable networks like CNN and MTV, which introduced the music video and launched the careers of many iconic artists. The AIDS crisis of the 1980s would go on to kill more than 700,000 people in the United States alone.

Reagan Revolution

The populist conservative movement known as the New Right enjoyed unprecedented growth in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It appealed to a diverse assortment of Americans including evangelical Christians, anti-tax crusaders, advocates of a more powerful American presence abroad, disaffected white liberals and defenders of a free market with few if any regulations.

Did You Know? At the beginning of the decade, as the Cold War showed no signs of easing, arms control advocates argued for a ""nuclear freeze"" agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1982, almost a million people rallied in support of the freeze in New York City's Central Park. Many historians believe this was the largest mass demonstration in American history.

The movement resonated with many citizens who had once supported more liberal policies but who no longer believed the Democratic Party represented their interests.

During and after the 1980 presidential election, these disaffected former liberals came to be known as “Reagan Democrats.” They contributed millions of crucial votes to the victory of Republican Ronald Reagan, the former actor and governor of California, over incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter.

Reaganomics

Here's Why Reaganomics is so Controversial

Reagan advocated for industrial deregulation, reductions in government spending and tax cuts for both individuals and corporations, as part of an economic plan he and his advisors referred to as “supply-side economics.” His economic and social agenda was largely shared by his across-the-pond friend, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

The resulting economic growth would allegedly “trickle down” to everyone—but whether it did or not is a matter of ongoing debate among politicians and economists. George H.W. Bush, campaigning against Reagan in the 1980 primary election, referred to his opponent’s economic policy as “voodoo economics.”

Reagan’s economic policies—known as Reaganomics—initially proved less successful than its partisans had hoped, particularly when it came to a key tenet of the plan: balancing the budget.

Huge increases in military spending—during the Reagan administration, Pentagon spending would reach $34 million an hour—were not offset by spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere. This fact, plus Reagan’s militaristic posture in international affairs, earned him the nickname “Ronald Ray-Gun.”

By early 1982, the United States was experiencing its worst recession since the Great Depression. Nine million people were unemployed in November of that year. Businesses closed, families lost their homes and farmers lost their land. The economy slowly righted itself, however, and Reaganomics grew popular again.

Even the stock market crash of October 1987 did little to undermine the confidence of middle-class and wealthy Americans in the president’s economic agenda. Many also overlooked the fact that Reagan’s policies created record budget deficits: During his eight years in office, the federal government accumulated more debt than it had in its entire history.

Reagan Doctrine

Like many other American leaders during the Cold War, Reagan believed that the spread of communism anywhere threatened freedom everywhere. As a result, his administration was eager to provide financial and military aid to anticommunist governments and insurgencies around the world. This policy, applied in nations including Grenada, El Salvador and Nicaragua, was known as the Reagan Doctrine.

In November 1986, it emerged that the White House had illegally sold arms to Iran in an effort to win the freedom of U.S. hostages in Lebanon, and then diverted money from the sales to Nicaraguan rebels known as the Contras. The Iran-Contra affair, as it became known, resulted in the convictions—later reversed—of Reagan’s national security adviser, John Poindexter, and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, a member of the National Security Council.

Despite its mixed track record, a majority of Americans still believed in the conservative agenda by the late 1980s. When Ronald Reagan left office in 1989, he had the highest approval rating of any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1988, Reagan’s vice president, George H. W. Bush, soundly defeated Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in the presidential election.

What Was the Iran-Contra Affair?

Fall of Communism

While Reagan and Thatcher trumpeted the march of conservative politics and capitalism, the foundations of communism grew increasingly shaky. In Poland, former electrician Lech Walesa led striking workers to form Solidarity, the first labor union to develop in a Soviet bloc nation. In 1980, representatives of the communist government of Poland agreed to the demands of the strikers.

In 1985, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev began to introduce the twin concepts of glasnost, or “openness"" and perestroika, or “restructuring,” to revive the moribund Soviet economy—but those efforts yielded few tangible results.

By the end of the 1980s, communism was in rapid retreat across Europe and Asia. The Berlin Wall, which had long divided the German city into an eastern, communist-held half and a western democratic half, was torn down by ecstatic crowds in 1989. And two years later, the Soviet Union collapsed.

In communist China, the Tiananmen Square protests—student-led demonstrations calling for democracy, free speech and a free press—began in the spring of 1989. In June of that year, the protests were ended by the Chinese government in a bloody crackdown known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

Yuppie Culture

In some respects, the popular culture of the 1980s reflected the era's political conservatism. For many people, the embodiment of the decade was the young, urban professional, or “yuppie,” a baby boomer with a college education, a good-paying job and expensive taste.

Many people derided yuppies for being self-centered and materialistic, and surveys of young urban professionals across the country showed that they were, indeed, more concerned with making money and buying consumer goods than their parents and grandparents had been.

Movies in the 1980s

Unlike the 1970s, when hard-hitting movies addressed controversial subjects, lighthearted fare seemed to reign supreme in the 1980s. Films like “Ghostbusters,” “Die Hard,” “The Breakfast Club” and “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” kept audiences enthralled and box office receipts high.

The decade was also the era when blockbusters dominated: Movies like “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,"" “Beverly Hills Cop” and mammoth franchises like the Indiana Jones, Back to the Future and Star Wars series appealed to moviegoers of all ages, making hundreds of millions of dollars in domestic and international releases.

But not everything was superficial escapism: Many now-famous directors honed their craft with dark, serious movies like David Lynch in “Blue Velvet” and “The Elephant Man,” Martin Scorsese in “Raging Bull” and Gus Van Sant in “Drugstore Cowboy.”

Television in the 1980s

At home, millions watched family sitcoms like “The Cosby Show,” “The Simpsons,” “thirtysomething” “Family Ties,” “Roseanne” and “Married...with Children.” They also skipped broadcast network fare and watched rented movies on their new VCRs.

By the end of the 1980s, broadcast networks realized they were in serious trouble as 60 percent of American television owners had cable service. Soon, cable companies like HBO, Cinemax, TBS and Nickelodeon were household names.

In 1980, the Cable News Network first aired, and soon CNN became a major player in delivering U.S. and international news via satellite worldwide, 24 hours a day. One year later, another revolutionary cable network, MTV, made its debut and completely changed the way Americans thought about music, dance and fashion.

Music in the 1980s

The music videos MTV played made stars out of bands like Duran Duran, R.E.M. and Culture Club and megastars out of artists like Madonna, Prince, Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson, whose elaborate ""Thriller"" video helped sell 600,000 albums in the five days after its first broadcast.

Later, MTV became a forum for those who went against the grain or were left out of predominantly white, yuppie culture. Rap and hip-hop artists such as Public Enemy channeled the frustration of urban Blacks into their powerful album “It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.”

But because of the consistent promotion of white musicians and bands on MTV, other venues soon opened up for emerging artists. BET, or Black Entertainment Television, premiered in 1980 as a challenger to MTV by promoting Black bands and musicians.

Hard rock acts such as Metallica and Guns N’ Roses captured the sense of malaise among young people, particularly young men. The 1980s also saw the growing popularity of electronic music, house music, reggae, new wave and other dance-club favorites.

Fashion in the 1980s

In addition to serving as a platform for music, MTV also influenced fashion: People across the country (and around the world) did their best to copy the hairstyles and fashions they saw in music videos. Soon, musicians like Madonna, MC Hammer and Boy George also became style icons.

But behind the gloss of MTV, another influence grew in both music and fashion: Punk culture and new-wave fashion, especially in London, grew from a late-1970s trend into a potent 1980s fashion force worldwide, with designers like Vivienne Westwood leading the charge. Ripped jeans and jackets—replete with safety pins and other metallic adornments—Doc Martens boots, spiked hair and heavy makeup were all the rage.

Other fashion trends from the 1980s included athletic wear—running shoes or basketball shoes, track suits and leg warmers—worn as everyday clothing. The preppy look, which mimicked the clothing worn by Ivy League students and buttoned-up professionals, invaded college campuses and nightclubs alike, following the success of “The Official Preppy Handbook,” published by Lisa Birnbach in 1980.

AIDS Crisis

In 1981, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other sources began reporting on an outbreak of unusual health conditions in otherwise healthy, young gay men in New York City, San Francisco and other urban areas.

Within a few years, an alarmed public learned about the spread of a deadly infectious disease now known as AIDS, or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, transmitted by direct contact with bodily fluids. Because it was initially dismissed by many—including the political and medical establishments—as occurring only among gay men, the disease spread rapidly, with at least 100,000 U.S. cases and an estimated 400,000 AIDS cases worldwide by the end of the 1980s.

After news broke that a number of popular figures—including Rock Hudson, Keith Haring, Magic Johnson, Greg Louganis and Liberace—were infected with the disease, the government, medical officials and the general public rallied to prevent the spread of AIDS and offer help to those affected.

Red ribbons supporting AIDS awareness soon adorned clothes, books, cars and public buildings, including the White House. The first antiviral treatment for AIDS, azidothymidine (AZT), was made available in 1987 and was followed by other, more advanced treatments, but the disease remains a health threat to this day.

Women in the News

Expanding on the hard-won rights that women earned in previous decades, women were leaders in many arenas in the 1980s, from politics to science and the arts. Maggie Thatcher was elected as the first woman prime minister of Great Britain, and Corazon Aquino—following the assassination of her husband, Senator Benigno Aquino Jr.—was ushered into office as the first women president of the Philippines.

U.S. astronaut Sally Ride became the first American woman to fly in space on the space shuttle Challenger in 1983. On the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O’Connor was appointed by President Reagan as the first woman to serve as associate justice.

Arguably the most famous woman of the era was Princess Diana, who married Charles, the Prince of Wales, in an elaborate 1981 televised wedding watched by some 750 million people around the world. Her visage was to grace television screens and magazine covers for many years thereafter until Diana’s death in 1997.

Disasters

A number of disasters, both natural and manmade, made headlines in the 1980s. The decade began with the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington. The titanic explosion claimed more than 50 human lives and destroyed thousands of acres of forest and rangeland.

In Bhopal, India, an explosion at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in 1984 led to the worst industrial accident in history. At least 2,000 people died and another 200,000 were injured when poisonous gas enveloped the city.

Memories of the 1979 nuclear disaster at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania were revived when the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine exploded in 1986, killing dozens of people, sickening many more and sending plumes of radioactive particles into the air as far as Sweden. Mikhail Gorbachev would later say the Chernobyl disaster “was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union five years later.”

Challenger Explosion

In Alaska, the pristine shores of Prince William Sound were stained black in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez tanker spilled some 11 million gallons of crude oil into the sea, killing hundreds of thousands of seabirds, otters, seals and whales. Even 30 years later, pockets of crude oil remained in some areas.

And in the blue skies above Cape Canaveral, Florida, the space shuttle Challenger exploded as millions of people watched on television and on the ground. All seven crew members aboard were killed.

Technology in the 1980s

Throughout the 1970s, computers were expensive devices that remained the province of a handful of garage tinkerers and multibillion-dollar entities like IBM and NASA. But all that changed during the 1980s, the decade that introduced the world to the video game Pac-Man.

IBM released the IBM Model 5150, the first IBM personal computer, to much fanfare in 1981. One year later, the Commodore 64 personal computer debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and TIME magazine named The Computer as its “Man of the Year.”

Soon, scattered computer users began to communicate with one another through an early network developed by the U.S. Department of Defense: ARPANET. In 1983, the network adopted TCP/IP, a set of communications protocols that led to the creation of the internet, and the modern era of computer communications was born.

With the personal computer, or PC, now available to middle-class consumers, Microsoft—founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen—soon became the dominant player in PC software. In 1983, Microsoft released Word, a simple, practical word-processing program, followed in 1985 by Windows, now the world’s most popular computer operating system. And Apple released its first Apple computer in 1984.

Communication took another leap forward when Motorola introduced the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X, a handheld cellular telephone. Weighing in at 1 lb., 12 ounces and 13 inches tall, the brick-like cell phone was a novelty at the time, but it heralded the beginning of a new era. By 2021, almost 15 million cell phones would be in use worldwide.

Personal pensions and compulsory scheme membership

The 1986 Financial Services Act introduced personal pensions, made changes to contracting out and stopped employers forcing employees to join an occupational pension scheme.

Personal pension plans which allowed both individuals and employers to contribute - became available on 1 July 1988. They replaced retirement annuity plans, which allowed an individual to build up a lump sum for retirement, part of which had to be used to buy an annuity and part of which could be taken as a tax-free lump sum.

This change coincided with the removal of the ability of employers to force employees to join an occupational pension scheme - something the then Department of Social Security flagged up in a series of adverts, showing how individuals could ‘break the chains' of compulsory scheme membership.

While personal pensions gave individuals more flexibility, it also led to the mis-selling scandal of the early 1990s, where some members decided not to join or to leave an occupational scheme with employer contributions in favour of a personal pension plan with only minimal contributions.

The scandal is estimated to have cost insurers and financial advisers at least £11.8bn in compensation payments.

Buck Consultants head of pensions policy Kevin LeGrand says personal pensions were the ""perfect example of the individual responsibility and freedom that marked the Thatcher years"".

He adds: ""While there is a lot to say for that in some instances, the way it was applied in pensions was I think, with hindsight, not the right way to go. No-one at the time seemed to realise the average man in the street wasn't equipped to deal with the freedom in relation to something like a pension scheme.""

However Barnett Waddingham consultant Malcolm McLean said he did not think it was right to attribute all the blame for the personal pensions mis-selling scandal on the government.

""Although there were a few mistakes in the government's promotional activities there was nothing inherently wrong with the concept and the industry must accept responsibility for what happened thereafter."" he says.

""Indeed the level of compensation that had to be awarded was ample proof of the scale of the abuse and the naked greed that accompanied it.""

Independent pensions adviser Ros Altmann adds: ""The principle was right, but the practice turned out to be problematic. Fees were too high, investment promises were too optimistic, reliance on annuities and inflexibility of products have all damaged DC pensions in practice. If expectations had been managed well and fees and charges had been more reasonable, without the lure of commission-induced hard-selling and transfers out, the retirement savings culture would not have been so badly damaged.""



Taxation of scheme surpluses

The Finance Act 1986 also saw the introduction of rules to reduce pension scheme surpluses.

The legislation forced schemes with funding levels in excess of a certain amount to reduce surpluses by making (taxable) payments back to the employer; suspending employer or employee contributions; improving benefits; or providing new benefits to members.

Prior to this legislation there was no specific provision for repayment of monies from a pension fund back to an employer. Individual schemes had to go back to the Superannunation Funds Office, the part of the Inland Revenue dedicated to dealing with occupational schemes, to get any refund individually approved.

Buck Consultants' LeGrand explains: ""It gradually started that, on an individual basis, you could go to the SFO and make the case and, if you successfully made the case, they would allow you to pay back some money to the employer""

Yet, because there was no provision to tax these repayments, LeGrand says some firms began to realise this was a good deal for the employer - as the money was tax free going in and not taxed coming out.

When companies started to publically state they would take money out of the scheme to boost profits - the politicians decided to take action.

The new rules led to a number of schemes refunding money to employers and many employers taking contribution holidays for a number of years.

Altmann explains: ""The taxation of pension fund surpluses was a huge, but unrecognised, negative influence on our defined benefit pension system.

""The so-called 'surpluses' were not really 'surpluses' but were funds needed for future pensions and risk buffers against unexpectedly bad markets or rising longevity. While the schemes were immature, they should have been keeping those surpluses in tact but, once they became taxable, there was an instant incentive for employers to ensure they were no longer there. If only we had had better funding buffers and risk margins, our pension system would be much stronger today.""



Disclosure regulations

Pension scheme disclosure regulations started to be introduced in 1986. This was the first time schemes were required to disclose certain information to members and trade unions - even if there was no sanction, and no regulator, to enforce the rules.

These regulations included requirements to complete an annual report and audited accounts and making them available to the member.

They also included rules forcing schemes to conduct a triennial actuarial valuation. Previously it had been common practice to have a valuation every five years.

LeGrand says: ""Good schemes already did this sort of thing but not necessarily in this way and this is probably one of the earliest examples of statute prescribing how a pension scheme should do things.""



Revaluation for Early Leavers

In order to prevent the value of deferred members' benefits diminishing over time through the effect of inflation, revaluation was introduced to preserved benefits through a number of pieces of legislation during the 1980s.

The Social Security Act 1985 introduced revaluation to preserved benefits in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) earned after 1 January 1985 - rules which came into force for leavers on or after 1 January 1986.

Preserved benefits were granted to members by the Social Security Act 1973 if they were over the age of 26 and had completed at least five years' qualifying service. However the Social Security Act 1986 reduced the qualifying service from five to two years.

There was further change in the Social Security Act 1990, which extended revaluation to cover the whole of the member's pension, in excess of the GMP. The annual increase applicable was the increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI), capped at 5% - sometimes known as ‘5% Limited Price Indexation - LPI'.

Further changes were introduced in the Pensions Act 2008 and the Pensions Act 2011, which allowed schemes to reduce the revaluation percentage and replaced RPI with the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) as the basis for the minimum statutory revaluation.

Commenting on www.professionalpensions.com, Aon Hewitt partner Jonathan Teasdale explains: ""This gave protection to scheme members against inflation - understandable given the background of large surpluses and the history of high inflation in the 1970s and 80s.

""But in hindsight it was part of the long-term trend towards legislative ‘gold-plating' that made DB pensions appear more expensive than employers felt they could afford.""



Earnings Cap

The 1989 UK Finance Act implemented an earnings cap that meant employers could in future only provide pensions for employees through a tax-approved company retirement scheme on the first £60,000 of their earnings.

It applied to people who joined an occupational pension scheme set up since 14 March 1989 - or who joined an occupational pension scheme from 1st June 1989, if the scheme was set up before 14 March 1989.

The limit was originally set at £60,000 for the 1989/90 tax year, a limit that was set to increase in line with prices on an annual basis thereafter.

The same limit applied to all personal pension schemes for the tax years from 1989/1990 onwards and was referred to as 'net relevant earnings'.

The Finance Act 2004 removed the compulsory Earnings Cap as part of the simplification reforms - replacing the cap with a lifetime allowance of £1.5m and an annual allowance of £215,000 from A-Day on 6 April, 2006.

Unapproved retirement schemes

As part of the same 1989 UK Finance Act, unapproved retirement schemes were also brought into being.

The new type of pension arrangement could provide unlimited retirement benefits - including additional retirement benefits for those caught by the new Earnings Cap.

The tax regime for these unapproved schemes was less generous, but there were still some tax advantages to be had.

The introduction of these schemes was significant because, until then, the granting to an employee of any retirement benefits that were not approved meant that his/her tax-approved benefits were prejudiced.



1980 Social Security Act

The 1980 Social Security Act saw the link between state pension increases and average earnings broken in a bid to cut spending.

Had the earnings link not been abolished, it is estimated the basic state pension would have been significantly higher today.

However, as was revealed by papers released by the National Archives in 2010 and reported on by The Guardian (see: http://tinyurl.com/cvbfo99), the then Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, had originally planned to go much further and wanted to cut the state pension by 3%.

However, faced with strong internal opposition, Thatcher abandoned Howe's plan with the government eventually settling on the abolition of the earnings link instead.

The link was only restored by the current coalition government through its ""triple lock"" arrangement in April 2011. The basic pension will now rise in line with average earnings, prices or 2.5%; whichever is the greater.

McLean believes this was one of the biggest pension mistakes made by the Thatcher governments. He says: ""Had the link not been broken the state pension would have kept ahead of the pension credit threshold and encouraged private saving without the risk of overlaps with means tested benefits.

""If that had happened we might not have needed the single-tier pension and the current pensioner population would have been a lot happier with their lot. It is even possible auto-enrolment would not have happened or would have proceeded in a different direction.""



Conclusions

In a straw poll of 86 people on www.professionalpensions.com, just 26% of respondents believed the pensions legacy of Baroness Thatcher's governments was positive. Nearly seven-tenths (69%) said the legacy was a negative one and 5% were unsure.

McLean has mixed feelings. He says: ""Bearing in mind what a visionary Thatcher was in some ways it is disappointing looking back that she failed to see what effect over-prescriptive regulation could have on an employer's ability/willingness to continue to provide final salary schemes or indeed how much at risk members of those schemes would be in the event of the firm going into liquidation."""

This is an experience you’ll spend most of your time watching, only occasionally using the controller to select speech options, complete quick-time-events, or walk around small areas interacting with objects. Gameplay is light and the entire game is less than three hours long, but as long as you know this going in, there’s an interesting experience to be had here.

The game’s 18 chapters follow Reza Shirazi, a photographer on the side of the revolution who uses his camera to capture Iran’s internal struggles. As you play, you will take pictures of in-game events such as protests and police brutality etc. Upon doing so, the game will often show you real-life photos of equivalent scenes; it’s a clever technique that brings the events to life and immerses you deeper into the story. You choose how much history you want to learn by taking or ignoring optional photograph opportunities and the brief educational text that comes with them.

On the other hand, whether you’re interested in the educational side of the game or not, Reza’s personal story is interesting as it follows his bonds with family and friends and the ways the revolution strains their relationships, testing everyone involved. Differing political opinions within the family put the protagonist in difficult situations and this is where player choice comes in to play. Looking past the unintuitive controls of the speech selection system, and the overly short time window to make choices in, the actions you choose can sometimes drastically affect later events. Oddly, some dialogue options ask for answers to questions that the player couldn’t know the answer to, so instead of making a moral choice to tell the truth or lie, these decisions leave the player guessing or choosing based on curiosity to see the results. These cases are the minority, but I found their inclusion strange. Combining this with an unusual control design and dialogue-selection timers that are too short, the game’s highlights usually come when it’s telling its story, rather than asking the player to help define it.

Voice acting is generally excellent, bringing characters to life effectively, as does the motion capture animation. Environment graphics are generally fine, not outstanding but not lacking either. Ultimately, each scene felt immersive enough and set the appropriate atmosphere; scenes with large crowds are a good example of this, though they can suffer from low framerates. Unfortunately, I did come across a severe bug that breaks audio and video to an unplayable degree, but is seemingly fixed by restarting the Switch console. This bug didn’t present itself in my second playthrough.

1979 Revolution: Black Friday has a great core concept that it executes well enough to warrant a playthrough, though ideally, some extra development time would have led to greater polish and a longer story. I enjoyed the experience enough to play it twice, though I hesitate to recommend the game to anyone who doesn’t have at least a small curiosity about political history and/or Middle-Eastern/Iranian culture."

The first atomic bomb was dropped by the United States on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. Three days later the second was dropped on Nagasaki. Hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians died and countless more had their lives blighted by the horror, by sickness and by loss. The Atomic Age had begun.
During the late 1940s and 50s, first the US, then the Soviet Union and Britain developed and tested new atomic weapons with ever increasing frequency. Not only were there fears of nuclear war breaking out but there was growing concern and protest around the world at the health risks and environmental damage caused by these atmospheric tests. By the late 1950s, these fears had become acute.

In the 1950s Europe was gripped by a very real fear of nuclear conflict and, building on the work of earlier anti-war movements, CND was launched with a massive public meeting in London in February 1958. Shortly afterwards at Easter the first Aldermaston March attracted a good deal of attention and the CND symbol appeared everywhere. From the outset people from all sections of society got involved. There were scientists, more aware than anyone else of the full extent of the dangers which nuclear weapons represented, along with religious leaders such as Canon John Collins of St Paul’s Cathedral, concerned to resist the moral evil which nuclear weapons represented. The Society of Friends (Quakers) was very supportive, as well as a wide range of academics, journalists, writers, actors and musicians. Labour Party members and trade unionists were overwhelmingly sympathetic as were people who had been involved in earlier anti-bomb campaigns organised by the British Peace Committee or the Direct Action Committee.
In the early years membership increased rapidly. CND’s advocacy of unilateral nuclear disarmament – the proposal that Britain should take the initiative and get rid of its own nuclear weapons, irrespective of the actions of others – caught the imagination of many. Multilateral disarmament – simultaneously by negotiations between countries – was clearly not working, although CND also strongly supported the goal of global abolition. The US, Soviet Union and Britain, (and later France and China), were building ever more nuclear weapons. All attempts to control, let alone reverse the process broke down repeatedly. (As an example, negotiations for a treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons began in 1958 but the final agreement was not reached until 1968).

 
In 1962 the Soviet Union was discovered to be installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, only 90 miles from the Florida coast. This very nearly provoked a nuclear war and although the Soviet Union pulled back at the last moment, both sides had been severely frightened.
The first telephone hot-line was set up between Washington and Moscow so the leaders could talk directly to each other. The Soviet missiles were taken out of Cuba and shortly afterwards US missiles already based in Turkey were quietly removed.
The next year a ban on nuclear testing in the atmosphere was agreed between the US, Soviet Union and Britain. For the first time the multilateral approach seemed to be working. International tension relaxed as the immediate threat of nuclear war faded away and CND numbers began to dwindle.
From the mid-1960s, nuclear issues were increasingly replaced as the subject of mass popular protest by anger over the United States’ war on Vietnam. CND continued but as a much smaller movement. But protests continued, particularly in Scotland where British nuclear-armed submarines were now based.
During these years, CND faced significant political challenges. Many CND supporters were Labour Party members and when CND’s unilateral line gained majority backing within the Party, it provoked a violent reaction from the leadership. When Harold Wilson won the 1964 Election, the new Labour Government simply ignored anti-nuclear feeling and continued with the previous Conservative Government’s nuclear policy.
There had also been internal arguments about whether it was ever legitimate to break the law. Supporters of non-violent direct action (NVDA) wanted the campaign to include mass civil disobedience actions such as sit-ins and blockades.

In 1960 the Committee of 100, led by the philosopher Bertrand Russell, was set up to organise mass civil disobedience. In February 1961 4,000 protesters sat down outside the Ministry of Defence in Whitehall. In September, 1,300 were arrested in Trafalgar Square and 350 at Holy Loch in Scotland where the UK nuclear submarines armed with US-loaned Polaris nuclear missile were based. The authorities began to arrest and imprison the organisers (including the 89-year-old philosopher Bertrand Russell).
There was strong support for the Committee of 100 among CND members but some of the leadership refused to accept any illegal activities.
The whole legal versus illegal debate is not a simple matter of the authorities (legal) against the demonstrators (illegal). The police, local authorities and even the state can act illegally or at least stretch the law in ways never intended. Many people also argue that it may be necessary to commit a lesser crime in order to prevent the greater one of nuclear war.
The principles and practice of NVDA were worked out in detail during this time so that when direct action came to the fore again in the 1980s, it was generally accepted by the peace movement as a legitimate form of protest.

In 1979 the decision was made to deploy US Cruise and Pershing missiles in Britain and several other Western European countries. At the same time the Soviet Union was deploying its new SS-20 missiles in Eastern Europe.
Suddenly the nuclear threat was back and talk of nuclear war commonplace. As more and more missiles were crowding ever closer to the East/West border, US President Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher seemed to have embarked on an anti-Soviet, anti-Communist crusade. Their speeches were full of fundamentalist rhetoric: of Us and Them, of Good versus Evil. People became frightened and many were angry that this new generation of US nuclear weapons was to be based in Europe.
Huge protest marches were held throughout Western Europe, and in Britain, CND blossomed. Thousands of new members were joining every month.

Cruise missiles were mounted on road vehicles and had to leave their base on regular exercises. Cruise Watch, a network of protesters, was formed to track and harass the Cruise convoys wherever they went. Because of the scale and the determination of the protests, the convoys soon had to have large police escorts and only left the camp under cover of darkness.
With huge demonstrations in London and elsewhere, opposition to Cruise and to other aspects of the government’s nuclear policy such as the very close links with the US, had become a major issue in British politics.
Renewed ridicule was heaped on the Government’s civil defence plans. These included do-it-yourself instructions on how to survive a nuclear attack in your own home. Meanwhile a network of underground bunkers had been built, not as mass air-raid shelters but as safe refuges for selected politicians and civil servants in case of nuclear war.

Among the many marches and demonstrations, one new element emerged: women-only activities.
In September 1981 a mainly women’s march from Cardiff arrived at Greenham Common US Air Force base in Berkshire, where the first Cruise missiles were to be based. What was at first a temporary camp soon became both a permanent peace camp and a women-only camp.
It quickly became a focus and a symbol of women’s resistance to what many saw as the male-dominated world of nuclear weapons. The Greenham Women, as they became known, were independent of CND, although many individual CND women members supported or joined the camp.
There was some opposition within CND and the wider peace movement to the fact that men were barred from the camp, but this largely melted away as the determination, imagination and energy of the Greenham Women became clear. In spite of press hostility and physical abuse including repeated, often quite brutal evictions, they stayed at the base, sometimes in their thousands, sometimes a few dozen only, but never giving up.
The Conservative government became alarmed. Michael Heseltine was made Minister of Defence in January 1983. A very important part of his brief was to counter CND’s influence. Not only was a well-funded anti-CND propaganda unit set up by the Government but the Intelligence Service (MI5) began to spy on CND activists: bugging their telephones and even infiltrating an agent into the London office.
At the same time several organisations opposed to CND and its policies became very active. Some played a legitimate part – for instance by providing speakers to debate in schools against Youth CND and publishing reasoned arguments in opposition to CND. Others had a less reputable role: disrupting meetings, publishing personal attacks, and attempting to attack and discredit the Labour Party, under the leadership of the staunchly pro-CND Michael Foot, for its renewed anti-nuclear policies. The connections between these organisations and the government and the exact sources of their funding were never quite clear.
Then the whole temper of international relations changed. A new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, took the initiative in calming the situation. Negotiations to remove the new missiles which had broken down in 1983 were resumed and a treaty signed in 1987.
Gorbachev’s reforms led over the next few years to the end of the Cold War, the reunification of East and West Germany, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe and finally the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Again, as people felt safer, CND’s membership began to decline.
In the last decades of the twentieth century, treaties covering nuclear proliferation and nuclear testing reinforced the belief that the immediate danger of nuclear war had faded away. Two peaks of renewed popular protest against nuclear weapons however followed the Gulf War in 1991 when there were considerable fears that Iraq would use chemical or biological weapons on Israel, which might then retaliate with nuclear weapons. A second wave of opposition internationally followed the 1995 French nuclear testing at Moruroa in the Pacific. This produced a wave of anger and protest around the world and served as an unwelcome reminder that the world was still full of nuclear weapons and that the development of new ones was continuing.


 
Since the start of the twenty-first century support for CND – and for the UK to get rid of its nuclear weapons – has risen substantially.
It is becoming less and less possible to justify the huge costs involved in both maintaining Trident, the current system and building its replacement, in the context of major government spending cuts. However, the Conservative government is committed to replacing Trident, with a final Parliamentary decision expected in the coming months.
As part of our campaign to Stop Trident and its replacement, CND campaigns both inside and outside Parliament, working with allies and supporters within the trade union movement, faith communities and civil society as a whole. Attitudes are changing across society and within the political parties too.
Although our main focus is on Trident and its replacement, after the criminal attacks of September 11th, 2001, we vigorously opposed the so-called ‘war on terror’ and the resulting war on Iraq based on trumped-up charges over weapons of mass destruction. We rejected war as a means of solving complex problems and advocated solutions based on dialogue and justice. CND also opposes nuclear-armed NATO and continues to make the links between nuclear weapons and other issues such as missile defence and nuclear power. We also campaign for a global ban on nuclear weapons.
CND has continuously reminded politicians and the general public alike about how immoral and destructive nuclear weapons are and how it would be (as it was before) a terrible human tragedy if they were ever used again. We have helped to create an environment in which the use of nuclear weapons cannot be considered. The majority of British people are now against nuclear weapons and it is the same globally. In practical terms we have, working with others nationally and internationally, also been an important force in pressing our government and others to conclude a number of treaties such as the Partial Test Ban Treaty, the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. We also campaigned strenuously against the Neutron bomb; plans for this appalling device were shelved as a result.
CND continues to attract strong support from all ages and walks of life and our members – who determine CND’s policy and direction through our democratic structures – are our greatest resource. There are huge amounts of experience, commitment and determination in our campaign and we will continue to work towards our goal until a world free of all nuclear weapons is achieved. With your help, we can do it – join CND today.

What really happened in Tiananmen Square in 1989?

It has been over 33 years since hundreds if not thousands of unarmed peaceful pro-democracy protesters were killed in Beijing and the arrest of tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities across China.

The protesters, based in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, were peacefully calling for political and economic reform. In response, the Chinese authorities responded with overwhelming force to repress the demonstrations.

Military units were brought in and unarmed protesters and onlookers were killed en masse. The Chinese government has never acknowledged the true events surrounding the Tiananmen massacre. It remains a contentious topic in China, with authorities banning all mention of the protest even today.

The Chinese authorities want everyone to forget that they killed hundreds, if not thousands, of unarmed peaceful pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.

Many refuse to forget Tiananmen Square. Human rights lawyer and activist Chow Hang-tung, who is wrongly imprisoned in Hong Kong, is one of them.

For many years, the human rights lawyer and activist Chow Hang-tung has helped to organise a peaceful annual remembrance of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. In 2021, after she posted on social media to encourage people to light candles at home, Chow Hang-tung was unjustly imprisoned in Hong Kong.

Who was Tank Man? Who photographed him?

The most famous photo of Tiananmen Square is known as ""Tank Man"". The Tiananmen protests were immortalised in Western media on 5 June 1989 through the image of a lone man in a white shirt carrying shopping bags, facing an imposing column of military tanks sent by the government to disperse protesters. The man is known simply as Tank Man: his identity has never been confirmed.

Tank Man would not let the military vehicles pass. He succeeded. Eventually, he was pulled out of the way of danger by onlookers. But the image of unarmed man versus tank quickly came to symbolise the struggle of the Tiananmen protesters - peaceful protest met with military might.

'It demonstrates one man's extraordinary courage, standing up in front of a row of tanks, being prepared to sacrifice his own life for the sake of social justice'

Stuart Franklin, Tank Man photographer

Stuart Franklin took the Tank Man photograph. In the short film below he talks about how he came to capture what would become one of the most iconic images of the twentieth century.

Events leading up to the Tiananmen Square crackdown

TIANANMEN: 33 YEARS ON

From April 1989 people from across China gathered in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to mourn the death of the liberal Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang and share their frustrations about the slow pace of promised reform.

The gathering turned into peaceful protests which spread across the provinces of China as demonstrators, mainly students, began to call for an end to official corruption and for political and economic reform.

How many people demonstrated? A million on the streets

On 13 May, hundreds of student protesters in Tiananmen Square went on hunger strike in order to push for talks with Communist Party leaders. It is estimated that one million people joined the protests in Beijing to express their support for the students on hunger strike and to demand reform.

What was the government's response? Martial Law

Party leaders visited the student protests on 19 May. The protesters ended their hunger strike that evening. However, the next day martial law was declared in Beijing to ‘firmly stop the unrest’.

In the weeks that followed the declaration of martial law, hundreds of thousands of people once again protested on the streets of Beijing, with similar demonstrations taking place in cities across China.

Military open fire on civilians

'The troops are by no means targeted at the students. Under no circumstances will [the troops] harm innocent people, let alone young students.'

Official New China News Agency, 1 May 1989

Overnight on 3 to 4 June, the government sent tens of thousands of armed troops and hundreds of armoured military vehicles into the city centre to enforce martial law and forcibly clear the streets of demonstrators. The government wanted to 'restore order' in the capital.

As they approached the demonstrations, troops opened fire on crowds of protesters and onlookers. They gave no warning before they started shooting.

'The first casualty in the square was rushed away - a girl with her face smashed and bloody, carried spread-eagled towards the trees. Another followed - a youth with a bloody mess around his chest.'

John Gittings, The Guardian

As the troops kept firing into the crowds, some of those running away were shot in the back. Others were crushed to death by military vehicles. No one knows the death toll from Tiananmen that night.

'We took the wounded on stretchers and went down [Tiananmen] Square. As we went down the side of the Square, we saw soldiers with large plastic bags. They were putting people in the bags. I could not tell how many people...

'There were also people surrounded by soldiers, being kicked by them. I could hear shouts and the odd gunshot. I thought there were around 200 young people. In early July, I heard from Public Security [police] sources that they had all been executed on 9 June in a rural district near Beijing. They included students and residents of Beijing.'

Eyewitness account from a protester

Crackdown following protests

Immediately after the military crackdown, the Chinese authorities began to hunt down those involved in the demonstrations. Thousands of people were detained, tortured, imprisoned or executed after unfair trials charged with ‘counter-revolutionary’ crimes.

The Chinese authorities have never disclosed the total number of people detained, tried or executed throughout China since the June 1989 crackdown.

In the climate of terror which followed the crackdown, the relatives of those killed were not only unable to seek justice for their loss; they were even unable to mourn openly the dead, who were officially described as ‘rioters’.

Tiananmen remains a banned subject in China

Tiananmen and the 1989 crackdown remains an official taboo topic in China. There is no official death toll. Attempts to discuss, commemorate and demand justice for what happened have been forcefully curbed, with no public discussion allowed. Since 1989 many people have been imprisoned for commemorating events or questioning the official line. Human rights lawyer and activist Chow Hang-tung arrested in Hong Kong is one of them.

Only recently a court in Changshu in eastern China found Gu Yimin guilty of inciting state subversion after he tried to post images of the post-Tiananmen crackdown online and applied to stage a protest on the 24th anniversary.

Most of the well-heeled film companies such as Rank, EMI and assorted Hollywood majors had either pulled out of British production altogether or were just about to. The newly elected Conservative government carried out its threat to scrap the Eady levy, which subsidised British film production via a percentage of all ticket sales. Competition from television and video did further damage, and the UK box office fell precipitately from 101 million admissions in 1980 to an all-time low of 54 million in 1984. And yet the decade began with the clarion call ""The British are coming!"", uttered by screenwriter Colin Welland on the night that Chariots of Fire (1981) won the first of the decade's three British Best Picture Oscars. The second, for Richard Attenborough 's long-gestating Gandhi (1982) and the third, for The Last Emperor (UK/Italy/China, 1987) suggested that we had also started producing genuinely popular big-budget epics for the first time since David Lean 's 1960s heyday. Lean himself returned with A Passage to India (1984), and he seemed to have a successor in Roland Joffé , who made The Killing Fields (1984) and The Mission (1986) under the aegis of David Puttnam , the closest thing to an authentic British film mogul since the days of Alexander Korda and Sam Spiegel . But the 1980s was generally a time of downsizing, retrenchment and upheaval. The standout production companies of the era - Goldcrest , HandMade , Palace , Working Title - generally operated on a much smaller scale than their predecessors. Indeed, a warning note was sounded when Goldcrest overstretched itself by simultaneously backing a big-budget star-driven historical epic ( Revolution , 1985), an ambitious and innovative musical ( Absolute Beginners , 1986) and the large-scale South American historical drama The Mission (1986) - and although the latter won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and became a modest commercial success, this came too late to make a difference. Hubris similarly met nemesis when Israeli moguls Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus , via their Cannon Group , bought up Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment , including its substantial cinema chain. The intention was to create a vertically-integrated business along the lines of the old Rank Organisation , but Cannon expanded too quickly and the mediocre box office performance of many of its films (mostly low-budget exploitation fare) proved unable to sustain it. HandMade and Palace were far more typical of the era. With a few exceptions such as the ill-fated Madonna / Sean Penn vehicle Shanghai Surprise (HandMade, 1986), their films were conceived on a modest scale: even Palace's ambitious fantasy The Company of Wolves (1984) only cost £4 million, and HandMade's surprise hit Time Bandits (1981) was even cheaper: director Terry Gilliam would later rue the day that he got involved with the runaway extravaganza The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), because until then his reputation stemmed from creating wildly imaginative worlds out of absurdly limited resources. (1985's Brazil also came in at much less than its baroque visuals would suggest). Perhaps appropriately for a company created to fund Life of Brian (1979), much of HandMade's output consisted of modestly-budgeted comedies, including A Private Function (1984) and Withnail & I (1986). The decade's other key theme was the greater synergy between large and small screen. Channel Four , which debuted in November 1982, would rapidly become a major player in British cinema once agreements had been reached over shortening the agreed window between cinema release and television airing. The domestic videocassette became a genuine mass medium by the early 1980s, unnerving the mainstream industry, which relished the chance to develop a genuine secondary market, but which was also concerned about piracy. Because major rightsholders initially shunned the video market, it was left open to scores of fly-by-night independents, many of whom took full advantage of the fact that censorship legislation had yet to catch up with technological progress. A moral panic over what the tabloids called 'video nasties' led to a draconian crackdown via the 1984 Video Recordings Act, which required almost all UK video releases to be officially vetted by the British Board of Film Censors (the last word was changed to 'Classification' in 1985). The only exceptions were some documentary and music videos. The music video, or pop promo, had been around since the mid-1970s, but the 1980s was the decade in which it first flourished, its aesthetic influencing several big-screen films ( Absolute Beginners , 1986; Aria , 1987) and providing an invaluable experimental training ground for many young directors - Julien Temple and Bernard Rose being good early examples, though old-timers like Ken Russell and Lindsay Anderson also jumped on a large and growing bandwagon. Of the established directors, Anderson,Russell, Ken Loach and Nicolas Roeg generally failed to match their earlier achievements. However, John Boorman , Jack Clayton , Derek Jarman , Terence Davies , Bill Douglas and the team of Ismail Merchant , James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala produced some of their best work - as did the veteran Lewis Gilbert , who turned the Willy Russell plays Educating Rita and Shirley Valentine into box-office gold (in 1983 and 1989 respectively). Mike Leigh and Stephen Frears returned to the big screen after more than a decade in television, although their contemporary Alan Clarke 's cinema films never matched the incendiary power of his best small-screen work. Many outstanding filmmakers saw their feature debuts released in the 1980s, including Bill Forsyth , Michael Radford , Alex Cox and Peter Greenaway , the latter graduating from the avant-garde to genuine commercial success with The Draughtsman's Contract (1982) and The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover (1989) with remarkably few compromises along the way. Several writers picked up the directorial megaphone, including Clive Barker , David Hare , Neil Jordan , David Leland , Philip Ridley and Bruce Robinson . The theatre proved a fertile breeding ground for new directors, including Richard Eyre , Mike Figgis and Kenneth Branagh , who made an enormous splash when he directed and starred in Henry V (1989) at the age of twenty-eight, a much darker, more sombre adaptation of Shakespeare 's play than Laurence Olivier 's wartime flagwaver. The 1980s also saw a substantial increase in the number of female directors, hitherto a vanishingly rare species. Sally Potter , Zelda Barron , Conny Templeman , Lezli-Ann Barrett and Beeban Kidron all made their feature debuts, while Mai Zetterling directed Scrubbers (1982) following several films in her native Sweden. Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen continued their creative collaboration, and Cinema Action 's Ann and Eduardo Guedes moved into features thanks to the backing of Channel Four. Other C4 beneficiaries included Amber Films , the Black Audio Film Collective , Ceddo and Sankofa - the last three providing welcome evidence that black filmmaking in Britain was building on the roots laid down by Horace Ové the previous decade. Although mainstream British cinema seemed obsessed with the Raj, new voices from Asian communities emerged, notably Hanif Kureishi , whose My Beautiful Laundrette (d. Stephen Frears, 1985) was one of the decade's most memorable state-of-the-nation snapshots, and also struck a major blow for gay cinema. Even Anglo-Chinese filmmaking, moribund for many decades, sputtered briefly into life with Ping Pong (1986) and Soursweet (1988). The 1980s also saw the start of what would become a genuine golden age of British animation, thanks to the enlightened patronage of organisations such as Channel Four and the BFI Production Board , which openly encouraged the kind of self-expression that had hitherto been much harder to slot in between bread-and-butter commercial commissions. Animators as diverse as Aardman and the Quay Brothers made major creative breakthroughs, while the decade's end saw the emergence of exceptional new talent such as Nick Park , David Anderson , Mark Baker and Joanna Quinn . As is often the case throughout British film history, some of the decade's best films were made by foreigners, including David Lynch ( The Elephant Man , 1980), John Landis ( An American Werewolf in London , 1981), Jerzy Skolimowski ( Moonlighting , 1982) and Nagisa Oshima ( Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence , 1983). Prominent British directors who worked mainly abroad in the 1980s included Alan Parker , Alex Cox , Adrian Lyne , and the brothers Ridley and Tony Scott , while David Puttnam headed Columbia Pictures from 1986-88 - but this came to a premature end after one clash too many with the conservative Hollywood community. The British may have been coming, but building a lasting empire proved a bigger challenge. Michael Brooke"

Introduction

Globally the 1980s saw Indira Gandhi becoming Prime Minister of India, with her second term of office brought to an abrupt end in 1984 with her assassination. In 1986, Corazon Aquino became the eleventh President of the Philippines. By 1984, in Britain, Women Against Pit Closures fought alongside the miners in an attempt to save the mining communities. One prominent woman representative was Anne Scargill, who came to Belfast to address the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) Women’s Conference in the Europa Hotel, seeking support for the families of the 142,000 mineworkers who were on strike.



In spite of the political unrest in Northern Ireland, the 1980s was a decade when women’s organisations expanded and provided a variety of services for women. The number of women’s centres in local communities increased with seven being established over the decade in the Greater Belfast area, as well as centres in Derry, Magherafelt, Craigavon and other areas. Whilst not underestimating the number of women who supported the paramilitary campaigns, there was a strong movement to work across sectarian and community divisions to build organisations and networks that would promote women’s rights. The women’s centres that were established offered personal support, advice, education and childcare services, with many also engaged in campaigning and advocacy for change. The centres were based in working class communities, serving as a lifeline for many women, especially single parents and those isolated in their homes; the centres also provided employment and voluntary work for local women (Ruth Taillon, 1992). Almost all were not-for-profit organisations, relying on local authority and philanthropic resources to maintain themselves. Funding continued to be a major issue and, in some cases, limited involvement in campaigning. Women’s centres have continued to survive in many communities and to offer services and support.

Context

Direct Rule continued in Northern Ireland under the administration of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Security was still the major policy priority, although presented under a mantra of ‘Normalisation, Criminalisation and Ulsterisation’. Notwithstanding this, both Republican and Loyalist paramilitary violence continued, as did British Army and police actions. No warning bombs and random killings created fear and over the course of the 1980s, 57 women were killed. As in previous decades, women also carried the primary responsibility of family maintenance and care when their husbands/partners, or other family members, were killed, injured or imprisoned.

In 1980, Republican prisoners began a hunger strike for recognition of political status that had been removed from both republican and loyalist prisoners in 1976. The inconclusive ending of this hunger strike set the seeds for a second hunger strike, which resulted in the deaths of 10 men. Thousands of women supported the Hunger Strike campaign; these were not only relatives of prisoners (many already involved in the Relatives Action Committees) but included large numbers of women from nationalist/Republican areas. The campaign also drew international support. In December 1980, three Republican women in Armagh prison joined the Hunger Strike. In 1981, Margaretta D'Arcy, having experienced three months imprisonment during the ‘dirty protest’ in Armagh prison, provided a graphic account of her experiences in Tell them everything: A Sojourn in the Prison of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at Ard Macha (Armagh).

Over the course of this decade, twelve people were killed by plastic bullets fired by British soldiers and police, seven in 1981 during the year of the hunger strikes, three of whom were female and two children. Emma Groves and Clara Reilly founded the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets; the aim of the organisation was to bring together the families bereaved or injured by rubber or plastic bullets and to achieve a ban on their use. By the mid-1980s, there was considerable community mobilisation against the Anglo-Irish Agreement (1985), particularly in Unionist/Loyalist areas, with women being involved. The end of the decade saw an upsurge in violence when the killing by the British Army of three unarmed IRA volunteers in Gibraltar – one of them was Mairead Farrell – set off a train of events that resulted in injuries and deaths as a result of Republican and Loyalist violence. At the same time, back-channel negotiations commenced involving leading politicians from the SDLP, members of the clergy and leading Republicans to explore alternatives to violence.



It was in the midst of this political unrest that the campaign for abortion law reform intensified with the establishment of the Northern Ireland Abortion Campaign (NIAC), prompted by the death of 21-year-old Charlotte Hutton from a “back street” abortion in Belfast. NIAC organised their first conference in 1980 and in the same year the group drew the issue to the attention of the Members of Parliament at Westminster, when Marie-Therese McGivern and Marilyn Hyndman delivered six hundred wire coat hangers to them, each bearing a facsimile of a British Airways ticket with the message, “these are the two ways in which Northern Ireland women get an abortion”. This action secured media attention, but not the required reform. The NIAC dissolved in 1984; however, the Northern Ireland Abortion Law Reform Association was established the following year. NIALRA continued the campaign to have the 1967 Abortion Act extended to Northern Ireland.

Adequate and free childcare continued to be an issue. Researchers/activists like Liz McShane and Eileen Evason pointed out that Northern Ireland had the worst level of childcare service compared to any other part of the United Kingdom. Full day nursery schools that catered for working women were practically non-existent. Most of the nursery schools, which had provided this service, had been opened in Northern Ireland during the Second World War and had subsequently closed, unlike the rest of Britain where many remained open. The few nursery schools that were attached to primary schools (which meant they were segregated on religious grounds) only offered care during school hours; however, they did increase from 68 in 1979/80 to 85 in 1988/89. Private nurseries and pre-school playgroups began to be established but fell short of the flexible and affordable childcare that was required by working women. Private childcare was too expensive for many working mothers and services offered by the charitable sector remained insufficient. Writing in 1982, Eileen Evason describes how the Foyle Day Care Centre in Derry was opened, founded by members of Derry Women’s Aid. The Foyle Day Care Association opened two purpose-built centres and 62 children were catered for.



The work by the Equal Opportunities Commission (NI) (EOC NI) gained momentum and many cases were taken on under the Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Order (NI) (1976). Awareness was raised about sexual harassment as an issue, and about discrimination related to pregnancy. One specific case that received significant media coverage was the High Court action brought against the Department of Education and the Education and Library Boards, concerning the 1987/88 Transfer Procedure. The EOC (NI) argued that the Departmental practice meant that some boys would be favoured above girls and awarded non-fee-paying places despite achieving lower marks and that this amounted to sex discrimination. The EOC (NI) won the case, and as a result, a total of 860 girls got places that year and the previous practice was ended.



Work patterns of women were beginning to change in line with family and childcare expectations. Fewer women were giving up paid employment for full-time childcare, families were getting smaller and equality legislation ensured that women could return to work after maternity leave. Employment figures showed the increasing participation of women in the labour force, albeit often in part-time work. Traditional manufacturing industries continued to decline, but there was an increase in the growth of the service sector, combined with what is euphemistically called “flexible” patterns of work (part-time, contract, temporary, seasonal, casual, and home based). This type of work was said to benefit the working mother, but in fact, it was predominantly dictated by employers’ requirements and did not suit every woman. A survey carried out in 1988, Cleaning Up - Women and the contract cleaning industry in N. Ireland exposed the ‘black market economy’ of contract cleaners, where employers took advantage of the fact that women could not complain or seek the help of trade unions because some of them also relied on welfare benefits. The survey highlighted the fact that these workers had no rights regarding hours of work, wages, holidays, duties, tea breaks and related conditions. The study conclusion held, prophetically, that “with Government policy supporting the privatisation of domestic services, this type of employment is set to increase."" A similar survey, Trim, Cut and Conditioned 1983, was carried out amongst hairdressing apprentices where at least 79% of those surveyed were earning less than £25 per week: £25 was the grant that was given to employers to train the apprentice. The training by employers was variable and survey concluded: “there would appear to be no recognised course of training applicable to all apprentice hairdressers, no accepted period or length of apprenticeship and little standardisation of qualifications.” Both surveys found a reluctance among the women to join a trade union for fear of losing their job.



However, trade union membership increased from 40,000 in 1953 to 107,300 in 1983. Robert Miller and Donal McDade (1993, p116) noted that an increase in the trade union membership of women offset an overall decline that was taking place generally. The rise in female membership led to some improvement in how trade unions dealt with the concerns of women. Women’s committees were established and in 1981, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) in Britain put together a resolution that rejected the idea of the “family wage”. Women in Northern Ireland continued to play a role in the ICTU women’s committee and they also attended the TUC Women’s Conference in Britain, sharing experiences and learning. The NIWRM met with a number of these women’s committees to develop policy and co-ordinate campaigning; this included the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance and the National Union of Public Employees. The Transport and General Workers union offered use of meeting space and a number of unions provided resources to NIWRM. In 1984, the ICTU conference passed a resolution on women’s health, resulting in the production of a booklet by the NI ICTU Women’s Committee, titled A Screen in Time Saves Lives, which encouraged women to use workplace facilities for cancer screening. This initiative was part of their broader campaign to have health education programmes introduced into more workplaces.

A Woman’s Right to Choose was one of the issues that remained controversial and low on the priorities of the trade union movement. The Anti-Strip Search Campaign, on the other hand, gained somewhat wider support when the Belfast Trades Council passed a motion that was subsequently supported at the ICTU women’s conference in Belfast in 1984; this motion called for an end to the strip-searching of all women prisoners. The demands of the women in prison were supported by a broader range of organisations and activists, but there was a concern that any such support might be interpreted as supporting paramilitarism. In addition, conflict existed within Republicanism, particularly between women from Provisional Sinn Fein and The Worker’s Party – two organisations that had a history of violent political feuding.

In contrast to organisations in Britain, women’s organisations in Northern Ireland found it almost impossible to access European Union (EU) funding. Conversely, Northern Ireland was categorised as a Priority One Region, which meant that the area was a priority for EU funding but given the political vacuum it was centrally controlled by the government. In 1985, Lynda Walker, an EOC (NI) commissioner attended a conference in Britain, which dealt with the subject of EU funded projects. This conference clarified that, in Britain, women’s organisations and colleges had considerably greater access to EU funding (including the ability to apply directly to the EU), resulting in the establishment of education and training provision, together with related childcare facilities. In 1986, a conference that was held in the Markets Community centre in Belfast, which examined EU funded projects in Britain and explored ways that such projects could be introduced into Northern Ireland. The Ulster University was one of the first organisations to draw down such funding.



In 1981, Jeff Dudgeon brought a case to the European Court of Human Rights where he successfully challenged Northern Ireland’s laws criminalising consensual sexual acts between men in private. Following this, the Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order (1982) came into effect. Although this did not directly affect women, given that it was not illegal for a woman to be a homosexual, politically the order raised the visibility of the issue. Lesbian women, however, felt that attention was more focused on gay men rather than the challenges they faced as lesbians. One young woman describes how she survived as a lesbian at this time; “being gay and living in Northern Ireland in the 1980s you just knew to keep your mouth shut”. There was limited space for lesbian women, but the Club Bar and the Chariot Rooms were places that were frequented by women from both sides of the community. Women’s News, a feminist newsletter, often featured articles about lesbians. Activist Marie Query commented, “As you’re probably aware there was a lot going on in the lesbian scene in the 70/80/90s and as you have gathered not a lot has been written up - Hidden from History eh? As you well remember in the bad old days, it was considered an insult to the women’s movement to say that it was about lesbians and their issues. Much of my time in the Women’s Centre in the early ’80s was taken up with advice (which I was ill-equipped to give!) to lesbian women who were suspended following the Kincora abuse cases and to mothers regarding lesbian custody issues and to mental health issues arising out the oppression of lesbian women. The change in the legislation in ’82 had little impact on these issues, many of which remained invisible. On the other hand, in my opinion, the male gay movement paid little attention to lesbian issues and few women were involved at a leadership level, sexism was prevalent in the gay movement as much as it was evident in the trade union movement and the political parties of the time.”

Marie Mulholland writes that in 1982 the first Lesbian & Gay Conference was held in Belfast in the Crescents Arts Centre and this brought lesbian and gay men from around Ireland and some from the UK to Belfast. For the few lesbians who were involved in organising the event with gay men, the opportunity to meet other activist lesbians from around the country and from England, some who were active in NUS, helped to create a web of lesbian networking and contacts. That conference in 1982 had a workshop, which challenged the sexism of gay men and their oppressive views and attitudes towards lesbians.

The 1980s began to see a more visible lesbian presence in the North but it was by no means widespread. In Belfast, the early 80s discos were held in the Midlands Hotel on York Road and as with most gay venues, the clientele was mostly male. Other locations were the Carpenter’s Club (Named after Edward Carpenter an English 19th century socialist and out gay man) and a favourite because of the great dance music was the upstairs club, Jim & Ernie’s, held in a dance studio on North Street. Although lesbians frequented all of these venues, they were predominantly male with the lesbian social scene often concentrated on house parties.

All that began to change in the mid-80s when a group of Belfast lesbians travelled to Cork to participate in the first Cork Women’s Weekend, a three-day long festival organised by the Lesbian community of the city, involving discos, live music, performance, workshops, pub quiz, and crafts fair. What the Cork lesbians had achieved fired up many Belfast lesbians to host an annual event in their own city. International Women’s Day or as it became International Women’s Weekend in Belfast became the place for lesbians from all over the island to congregate- the main event was the Cabaret on the Saturday night, many of the acts were women from around the country but soon the cabaret was attracting lesbian acts from the UK and even the US. By 1988, the first Women’s Summer Camp had taken place in Galway-three weeks of ‘women only’ space camping in the outdoors, building sweat tents, communal kitchen. The camp recognised women’s economic status by having a sliding scale for those unwaged and low waged and with children. The Camp is still going strong and takes place in various counties around Ireland where land can be sourced and rented for the three weeks. The camp dates always and still do coincide with the period over July 12th to provide Northern lesbians with somewhere to go to get away from the Orange Parades. Throughout the 80s and into the 90s there was an all-Ireland circuit of events for lesbians; IWD in Belfast, Cork Women’s May Weekend and the July Women’s Camp in Galway and around the South.



The exchanges between lesbians in Cork and lesbians in Belfast began during the 80s when each group attended the others’ events. Several of these exchanges were funded by Co-Operation North at the time.



It should be noted that these events used the broad term ’women’ and did not promote themselves as specifically lesbian events. To do so at that time would have invited a level of risk and censorship, which could undo the possibilities for any coming together, however, these events were lesbian- organised, lesbian- inspired. They were open to all women but predominately lesbian attended (Marie Mulholland, 2018).

The Belfast Women’s Collective dissolved during this period, due mainly to the polarisation within the women’s movement characterised by tension between those who prioritised ‘the National Question’ and those who prioritised feminist politics. Many of the members who had been in the collective went on to make effective contributions to other groups, for example, the NI Abortion Campaign and the Women and Media group.

In 1986, the NIWRM organised a delegation of twelve women to lobby politicians in the House of Commons on the Fowler review – legislation that would reduce welfare benefits. Most of the women who travelled came from Protestant backgrounds; women from nationalist/republican areas were reticent about the tactic because they did not recognise the jurisdiction of Westminster. When the delegation arrived, they were met by a single Northern Irish MP (Unionist). Speaking to a Protestant woman from Ballybeen, the MP condemned “benefit scroungers” and, adopting a sectarian viewpoint, associated social security benefits with Catholics. The woman responded by informing the MP that her husband had lost his job and that it was not worth her while working part-time because it would affect his benefit.

The delegation also met with Tony Benn who, upon hearing that the women were from Belfast, spoke only about the need to withdraw British troops. It is clear that both MPs had preconceived ideas with respect to political affiliations and views of the women. During the visit, it was found that the most helpful person was Joan Maynard, Labour MP for Brightside Sheffield, who took several of the delegates into the House of Commons restaurant where they met the MP for Derry. The delegation included Elaine Spence and Brenda Gillham (sisters of Belfast-born Beirut hostage, Brian Keenan), Geraldine Bradley, Lynda Walker from Belfast Woman’s Centre, Annie Walker from Ballybeen Woman’s Centre, Hazel Morrissey who was the education officer at the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union and Michelle Devlin. Derry woman, Helen Brady, who lived in London, met the group at Downing Street, where they handed in a letter of protest to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

In 1987, NIWRM organised a delegation of 44 women from all over Ireland to attend the World Congress of Women in Moscow. These included a Catholic nun, a TD (MP in the Republic of Ireland); two Dunnes Store strikers (on the issue of apartheid), Annie Walker from Ballybeen Women’s Centre, a traveller, trades unionist Inez McCormack, women from the AT & GWU Women’s Committee and community activists from Derry, Cork, Dublin and Belfast. Emma Groves and Clara Reilly gave evidence to a human rights committee regarding the use of plastic bullets.



The NIWRM movement held its first of many all-women artist concerts in 1981. The proceeds from the event went to the Belfast Women’s Centre, which by this time employed its first part-time worker Marie Query. In 1985, Ruth Hooley (now Carr) produced The Female Line to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the NIWRM, the publication challenged the existing male norm, and “it was the first anthology of literature by women writers from Northern Ireland, several of whom made their publishing debut in its pages” (Irish Times, 2017). This volume highlighted the work of 45 published and unpublished women writers, and provided encouragement for women experimenting in a range of literary genres.



In the mid-1980s, Nuala McKeever joined a number of students at Queen’s University Belfast, starting what would become the Hole in the Wall Theatre Company. After a trip to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1988, the group was trimmed down to five members with Nuala was one of the five. They wrote and produced comedies that satirised life in Northern Ireland. Playwrights such as Ann Devlin, Marie Jones, Christina Reid and Polly Devlin provided a female perspective on ‘the Troubles’, while Frances Molloy used the novel form to the same effect. Many of these women are remembered by the photographs on the walls of the back room in the John Hewitt pub in Donegall Street. Some interesting details about the lives and works of Christina Reid and Marie Jones are recorded by Conall Parr in his latest book (2017).

On Wednesday the 30th January 1980, the first of 6 radio programmes was broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster. The programmes dealt with women in relation to marriage, health, childcare, education, work and violence. The research for the programmes was co-ordinated by Avila Kilmurray in the Community Action Research and Education Centre in Magee College Derry and they were broadcast on Radio Foyle in February of that year. This was part of a wider community education programme.

Throughout the 70s, 80s and 90s, art and culture developed in and around the politics of society in Northern Ireland, through songs and poetry, wall murals, plays and other forms of art. Artist Rita Duffy describes this, pointing out, “I think all art is political, whether it’s choosing to draw a bowl of fruit or choosing to make a painting about knee-capping. One is introvertedly political, the other is overtly political. One is about choosing to ignore difficult issues and make art that is more sellable and suitable to a middle-class drawing room; the other is obviously dealing with a political trauma. I remember a very poignant moment in art school when my tutor asked me why people on the streets were wearing black armbands. This was a man who had lived in Belfast for over 12 years. I told him that it was because the second Hunger Striker had died. I realised that this man was living and teaching art in Belfast but his head, heart and consciousness were elsewhere. This was startling to me. I wanted my art to engage with what was going on around me at that time.” Rita designed an International Women’s Day poster for the NIWRM and in 2011; she designed and constructed a wall mural to mark the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day. She explains the feminist agenda in her work: “We have a deeply misogynistic, patriarchal society here in Northern Ireland. Women’s voices really need to be heard here. One thing I am continually coming back to is the realisation of just how difficult women’s lives are here. When you have a society that is dominated by violence and pinned so firmly in the dogma and imagery of Christian patriarchy – this fundamentalist, God-is-a-man head-space – it’s inevitable that women will be marginalised. We still have a residual sense that the little wife should be at home dealing with the babies. I was born female and therefore women’s issues and feminism seem obvious and important concerns for me as an artist” (Culture NI.org).

During this decade, feminism as an ideology was becoming increasingly normalised in at least some political circles and feminist historians, sociologists and political writers began to make an impact. In the mid-1980s, Northern Ireland’s first Women’s Studies undergraduate course was provided at the Ulster University and Eileen Evason noted that the Women’s Studies branch of the Workers Education Association (WEA) played a major role across Northern Ireland regarding the empowerment of women. The Women’s Education Project, along with the Well Women’s Centre and the WEA, all acted as a resource for community-based women’s groups.

The album limped to a humbling No.22 in the US, and a fractious tour of the States ended at the LA Forum – the last date the original Queen lineup would ever play in America.
May returned to basics with Hammer To Fall: a crunching rocker that could have fallen off a Queen album from the 70s.
“To them it was boys dressing up as girls and it was unthinkable, especially for a rock band.
And at the end of the night, the frontman’s heartfelt last words from the stage – from any stage – had a sense of finality befitting what would be the last show by the classic Queen lineup.","lineup, miraculous, told, mercury, america, play, band, taylor, space, 1980s, queen, rock","For the rock galacticos of the 70s, the transition into a new decade proved a difficult gearshift. By the end of 1980, Led Zeppelin had been sunk by the death of talismanic drummer John Bonham. Unravelling alongside them were The Who, and while the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd continued to play to packed stadia, the crowds increasingly called out for the old songs.

In this age of stumbling giants, Queen hit the 80s like a train. Already, the band had kissed off the 70s with their biggest US hit to date, in the form of rockabilly pastiche Crazy Little Thing Called Love. Dreamt up by Mercury in a Munich bathtub and captured by incoming producer Reinhold Mack at that city’s Musicland Studios, the single seemed the launchpad to an imperious decade – even if Brian May told Guitar World that the lineup operated less through design as dumb luck: “Everyone thought we had this huge monster plan, the Queen Machine, but it’s an illusion.”

Happy accident or otherwise, by February 1980, the band were keen to capitalise, returning to the same Bavarian studio for a four-month hot-streak, where the four members’ prolific output was underlined by the 40-odd songs pitched for inclusion on that year’s The Game. “For me, the band was functioning well at this point,” noted Roger Taylor in Mark Blake’s definitive biography of the band, Is This The Real Life? “The Game was much more of a piece than Jazz. Our songwriting was much better.”

May would recall putting in long shifts at the Musicland console “at three o’clock, trying to make something work”. But the lineup played hard too, albeit separately, with Mercury holding court at the Old Mrs Henderson gay club while the other band members repaired to Sugar Shack, a local disco that would prove hugely influential on their evolving sound.

“We would take tracks down there after hours and play them over their system to see how they worked,” reflected May. “Anything with a bit of groove sounded good. We became obsessed with leaving space in our music and making songs that would sound great in the Sugar Shack.”

The venue’s vibe would spill into the guitarist’s own Dragon Attack, a funky jam reportedly fuelled by vodka and tonics. But more significant was its thumbprint on Queen’s biggest hit of the decade: Another One Bites The Dust.

While tipping a hat to the Munich club scene, John Deacon’s three-note bassline was also the product of both his Motown-fixated youth and a chance overhearing of an early version of US funk icons Chic’s 1979 Risqué while hanging out with that band’s bassist Bernard Edwards in New York (“What isn’t cool,” the American later told NME, “is that the press started saying we had ripped them off.”).

And while the rest of the band were bemused – May recalling that “[we] had no idea what Deakey was doing” and that Taylor’s initial response was “unprintable” – they soon fell into the groove. Taylor’s drums were deliciously dry and clipped. May’s funk riffs scritch-scratched between the warm bassline. Mercury was “so into what we were doing”, recalled the guitarist, “that he sang until his throat bled”.

It was a rare moment of synergy in an often bad-tempered session. Wary of Mack since being asked to relinquish his Red Special and play a Fender Telecaster on Crazy Little Thing Called Love, May now niggled with his producer over the approach to tracking guitars.

On the brink of his debut solo album, Fun In Space, Taylor seemed particularly restless, pitching up to sessions with an Oberheim OB-X – past Queen albums had pointedly claimed ‘No Synthesisers’ – and pushing to sing the lead on Rock It (the song ultimately saw the drummer and Mercury share vocal duties).

“Keeping the focus,” Mack told iZotope, “was difficult at the best of times with this mixture of personalities.”

“There were huge rows in the studio,” noted Taylor. “Usually over how long Brian was taking, or whether he was having an omelette. We drove each other nuts.”

“We all walked out at various times,” May recalled. “You get hard times, as in any relationship. We definitely did. Usually in the studio; never on tour. On tour, you always have a clear, common aim. But in the studio you’re all pulling in different directions and it can be very frustrating. You only get twenty-five per cent of your own way at the best of times. So, yes, we did have hard times. Feeling that you’re not being represented, that you’re not being heard. Because that’s one of the things about being a musician, you want to be heard. You want your ideas to be out there. You want to be able to explore what’s coming to you in the way of inspiration. It was a difficult compromise to find, but always worth finding once you did find it.”

Mercury was more succinct on the dynamic: “Four cocks fighting – lovely!”

But for now, the numbers papered over the cracks. Released in June 1980, The Game stormed to No.1 on both sides of the Atlantic, the sense of a reinvigorated band completed by a leather-jacketed sleeve shot that retooled these 70s peacocks for the new era.

Forty-six US dates climaxed with Mercury firing champagne over the crowd during a three-night residency at New York’s Madison Square Garden; in the UK, the band christened the newly opened Birmingham NEC.

By comparison, it was inevitable that the same year’s Flash Gordon soundtrack seemed a little slight.

“We wanted to write the first rock’n’roll musical,” Taylor told Blake of the latter. “It was a very camp film, but I thought our music suited the film in all its camp awfulness.” While Another One Bites The Dust reached No.1 in the US, becoming Queen’s definitive Stateside hit, the lineup hadn’t failed to notice their rocketing numbers in South America, where the single’s chart-topping performance in both Argentina and Guatemala gave Queen a claim to be that continent’s biggest rock band.

In 1981, the band transplanted their live rig for shows on an unprecedented scale, shifting some 100 tons of equipment, even travelling with artificial turf to protect the hallowed stadium pitches at feverish shows in Buenos Aires, Mar Del Plata, Rosario and São Paulo.

They were the heavy, heavy police, who actually kill people at the drop of a hat Freddie Mercury

Blowing through the continent on a trek that played to a record paying crowd of 231,000 in São Paulo, and grossed $3.5 million in total, the hysteria required an armed convoy – and for each band member to be issued a bodyguard brought in from the seamier end of Brazil’s military.

“They were the heavy, heavy police, who actually kill people at the drop of a hat,” noted a momentarily serious Mercury. If Deacon’s Another One Bites The Dust bassline was the soundtrack of 1980, it would be challenged the next year by another low-end groove, as Mercury and David Bowie tested each other’s talents – and patience – on Under Pressure.

Wine and cocaine flowed in a 24-hour session at Montreux’s Mountain Studios, but if the resulting single sounded magnanimous – with both singers trading lead vocals, many of them improvised – May remembers otherwise. “It was very hard,” he said in 2008, “because you already had four precocious boys and David, who was precocious enough for all of us. Passions ran very high. I found it very hard because I got so little of my own way. But David had a real vision and he took over the song lyrically.”

When even a rough monitor mix of Under Pressure strolled to No.1 in the UK, it seemed typical of a band who now appeared to snatch victory at every turn. But that impression was about to be rudely shattered by the song’s parent album.

Hot Space was the stumble that broke the band’s imperious run, the disjointed product of a lineup fractured by excess and the divide-and-rule tactics of Mercury’s personal manager, Paul Prenter (“He led Freddie by the nose,” one band associate told Blake).

“We had got fairly decadent by then,” admitted Taylor. “We started work at all sorts of odd hours. The days drifted into the nights in this endless cycle.”

You could hear the division on Hot Space. Mining the same spare dance groove as Another One Bites The Dust, this time around, the results were anaemic and light on the anthemics required to fill Queen’s stadiums. May and Deacon butted heads over guitar tones on Back Chat. Mercury shot down May’s requests for more volume (“What the fucking hell do you want, a herd of wildebeest charging from one side to the other?”).

Meanwhile, the married-with-children lineup had grown weary of the singer celebrating his promiscuity in song. “I can remember having a go at Freddie because some of the stuff he was writing was very definitely on the gay side,” said May. “I remember saying it would be nice if this stuff could be universally applicable, because we have friends of every persuasion.”

Released in May 1982 – and preceded by Body Language, a chilly synth-funk single that virtually erased May’s role in the band – Taylor even decried the sleeve of Hot Space (“Absolute shit”).

That consensus was echoed across the planet. Crowds in Germany responded to cuts like Staying Power with cat-calls (“If you don’t want to listen to it,” snapped Mercury, “fucking go home!”).

The album limped to a humbling No.22 in the US, and a fractious tour of the States ended at the LA Forum – the last date the original Queen lineup would ever play in America. May told it straight: “We hated each other for a while.”

In 1983, a trial separation saw the band members dive into solo work, with May drafting Eddie Van Halen for the admired but under-selling Star Fleet Project, while Mercury held an abortive session with Michael Jackson and chipped away at 1985’s Mr Bad Guy.

But the band that May dubbed ‘the mothership’ – for all its attendant headaches – still exerted a powerful pull. By year’s end, the lineup were ensconced at LA’s Record Plant, where Taylor – wounded at being told his offerings weren’t up to snuff – served up Radio Ga Ga: a yearning, pulsing electro-ballad created on synths and drum machines, complete with a lyric about “how important radio used to be” and a handclap hook that would rival We Will Rock You for its live Pavlovian response.

“I think Roger was thinking about it as just another track,” noted Mercury, who was invited by the drummer to finish the song. “But I instantly felt there was something in there, a really good, strong, saleable commodity.” Taylor’s intention to give fans “the works” gifted the album its title and was a fair summary of material that ran the gamut.

May returned to basics with Hammer To Fall: a crunching rocker that could have fallen off a Queen album from the 70s. Mercury supplied the reflective lilt of It’s A Hard Life (a song tainted by a dressing-up box video that the band despised).

Meanwhile, Deacon again lived up to his billing as the band’s secret weapon with I Want To Break Free, whose wistful escapism would give the band both another signature tune and a No.3 single in the UK.

Unlike Hot Space – which had dragged frustrated fans too far into leftfield – The Works felt like a band still questing, while also acknowledging their classic sound.

“I see it as being a lot closer to the middle period than the last three or four albums,” May told Guitar World at the time. “A lot closer to A Night At The Opera and News Of The World and a little bit like The Game. But some of the writing is the next step beyond, it’s not going back in time. Because we’ve integrated some of the modern technologies. But we haven’t gone totally towards machine music because the fact is we don’t like it.”

On home turf, the upturn was palpable, with The Works hitting No.2 in the UK and clinging to the domestic chart for 93 weeks. But the impression that America had turned away was cemented by I Want To Break Free’s infamous video, featuring the band dragged up as servile housewives, with Mercury pushing a vacuum cleaner in a padded bra and black leather miniskirt.

Middle America didn’t get the joke, and the band – in their first incarnation, at least – never recovered there. “I know it was received with horror in the greater part of America,” May told writer Mick Wall. “To them it was boys dressing up as girls and it was unthinkable, especially for a rock band. I was actually in some of those TV stations when they got the thing and a lot of them refused to play it. They were visibly embarrassed about having to deal with it.”

No longer a band prepared to slum it, Queen decided that trawling a cooling America was no priority for them. “And we were not seen for quite a long time in the States,” May noted. “Freddie didn’t want to go back smaller than we’d been before. He was like: ‘Let’s just wait, and then soon we’ll go out and we’ll do stadiums in America as well.’ Only of course we never did.”

The international circuit was clamouring, but the band’s broadening horizons would lead to the era’s most serious misstep. Developed by hotel mogul Sol Kerzner and opened in 1979 in the North West Province of South Africa, the Sun City resort was a paradise of twinkling pools and lush gardens – tainted by its uncomfortable tag as the ‘apartheid Las Vegas’.

With the country still gripped by segregation, the United Nations’ cultural boycott demanded that musicians resist the lure of playing there – even in the face of Kerzner’s generous fees. Queen weren’t the first marquee name to break the red line – Rod Stewart and Elton John had both appeared at Sun City in 1983 – but their residency in October 1984 sparked the fiercest opprobrium.

The band fought their corner, pointing out that they had insisted on playing to an integrated audience and staying in a mixed hotel. “Those criticisms are absolutely and definitely not justified,” argued Brian May in a fractious Smash Hits interview. “We’re totally against apartheid and all it stands for, but I feel that by going there, we did a lot of bridge building. We actually met musicians of both colours. They all welcomed us with open arms. The only criticism we got was from outside South Africa.""

It cut no ice. In the UK, the Musicians’ Union issued a hefty fine, while the band found themselves on the UN’s cultural blacklist. The poison from the incident dripped into publications like NME, where socially conscious artists like Paul Weller wagged their fingers.

By 1985, as Steven Van Zandt’s Artists United Against Apartheid released the protest song Sun City – key lyric: “I ain’t gonna play Sun City!” – Queen seemed like pariahs on the wrong side of history.

Commercially, all was not lost. In January 1985, Queen played to 300,000 fans at Rock In Rio, a performance only marred by Mercury’s pelting with rocks and cans during a drag routine for I Want To Break Free (he calmed the crowd by singing We Will Rock You in a double-sided flag, with the Union Jack flipped to reveal the Bandeira Do Brasil).

Even then, the sense lingered that for Queen to be embraced again on home soil, it would take a redemption on an almost impossibly epic scale. The kind of redemption that only Live Aid could offer. May would recall in Smash Hits that the band almost snubbed Bob Geldof’s invitation to play the biggest charity gig ever staged: “Our first reaction was ‘Oh God! Not another one. We’d been involved in quite a few and we were a bit disillusioned as to how the whole business works.""

But on that day in July, Queen’s six-song set was a resurrection, launching them into the One Vision single, 1986’s A Kind Of Magic album and the restorative Magic Tour, its 26-date arena itinerary speaking of a band emphatically back in business.

Playing to over 400,000 fans and grossing more than £11 million, dates at Maine Road, St James’ Park and Slane Castle were topped by two storied shows at Wembley Stadium, where a 64-foot stage and twin ego ramps lived up to Taylor’s promise that “it will make Ben Hur look like The Muppets”.

And if the lineup’s previous hands-across-the-water gesture in South Africa had fallen flat, there were no such ethical issues with their arrival at Budapest’s Népstadion, where 80,000 fans were let off the leash by the ruling Communist party’s authoritarian prime minister, György Lázár (who allowed clapping for the night, if not drinking and smoking).

By the time Mercury had serenaded the stadium with local folk standard Tavaszi Szél Vizet Áraszt – the lyrics scrawled on his palm – the reaction, as May told it, “was fucking deafening”. And yet, amid these myriad triumphs, an aside from Mercury in Budapest was darkly prophetic, the singer responding to a reporter’s enquiry as to whether he planned to return to Eastern Europe,

Officially, Mercury would not learn of his HIV diagnosis until Spring 1987. But with the tabloid press speculating about an earlier Aids test in Harley Street, confidant Barbara Valentin claiming he had already shown symptoms and ex-lover Tony Bastin shortly to die of the disease, perhaps the singer sensed the gathering storm clouds. Mercury would return to Budapest, he replied that day, “if I’m still alive”.

The show went on – and the finale could only be Knebworth Park. On August 9, 1986, a sea of 120,000 fans awaited the helicopter touchdown of a band who could go no higher. Every corner of the catalogue was mined for gold; every thrust and jab of Mercury’s microphone caught on the site’s giant TV screens.

The Miracle album of 1989 still lay ahead, but this was the truest swansong to the band’s larger-than-life decade. And at the end of the night, the frontman’s heartfelt last words from the stage – from any stage – had a sense of finality befitting what would be the last show by the classic Queen lineup. “Goodnight and sweet dreams…"""

With their flamboyant outfits and matching looks pop group Wham embodied 80s style.

Throughout the bands success George Michael and Andrew Ridgley delighted their legions of fans with their unique mix of logo T-shirts, relaxed 80s tailoring, cowboy hats, dazzling white ensembles and head to toe denim.

Their iconic Wham ‘Choose Life’ T-shirts were a trend that crossed gender boundaries.

A memorable concert was when the pair wore matching Fila shorts and open zip up tops when they performed on stage.

Other matching looks included crop tops, white suits and stone washed denim. Their memorable shirtless looks sent fans wild.

One of George’s trademark looks were his gold hoops and of course THE hair. If there was one hair style that defined the 80s it was George's.

Men and women alike both adopted his famous highlighted flick and sales of styling products went through the roof.

George reinvented designer stubble making it popular in the 80s. Arguably the most famous stubble wearer of all time, it was an integral part of his look.

In 1987 when George released his first debut album Faith he unveiled a new look. His crucifix earrings were soon adopted by his legion of loyal fans.

The black leather jacket, jeans and cowboy hat that he wore to collect his Ivor Novello award after Faith was judged international hit of the year became another memorable iconic look.

His influence on fashion and style were cemented with the iconoclastic video for his hit song Freedom! ‘90, which featured the original supermodels Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, and Tatjana Patitz.

Through out his career George challenged gender stereo types and encouraged a generation of fans to be truly unique.

More recently George had adopted a new smarter look, performing in a selection of sharp tailored suits.

But while his iconic locks had been replaced with closely cropped hair, he still stood out adding sunglasses and an oversized crucifix.

Its architect, President Mikhail Gorbachev, oversaw the most fundamental changes to his nation’s economic engine and political structure since the Russian Revolution of 1917. But the suddenness of these reforms, coupled with growing instability both inside and outside the Soviet Union, would contribute to the collapse of the U.S.S.R. in 1991.

Early Attempts at Reform

In May 1985, two months after coming to power, Mikhail Gorbachev delivered a speech in St. Petersburg (then known as Leningrad), in which he publicly criticized the inefficient economic system of the Soviet Union, making him the first Communist leader to do so.

This was followed by a February 1986 speech to the Communist Party Congress, in which he expanded upon the need for political and economic restructuring, or perestroika, and called for a new era of transparency and openness, or glasnost.

But by 1987, these early attempts at reform had achieved little, and Gorbachev embarked on a more ambitious program.

Russian Capitalism After Communism

What Is Perestroika?

Gorbachev’s perestroika program loosened centralized control of many businesses, allowing some farmers and manufacturers to decide for themselves which products to make, how many to produce, and what to charge for them.

This incentivized them to aim for profits, but it also went against the strict price controls that had been the bedrock of Soviet economic policies. It was a move that rankled many high-ranking officials who had previously headed these powerful central committees.

In May 1988, Gorbachev introduced a new policy that allowed for the creation of limited co-operative businesses within the Soviet Union, which led to the rise of privately owned stores, restaurants and manufacturers. Not since the short-lived New Economic Policy of Vladimir Lenin, instituted in 1922 after the Russian civil war, had aspects of free-market capitalism been permitted in the U.S.S.R.

But even here, Gorbachev tread lightly. As William Taubman, historian and author of Gorbachev: His Life and Times, notes, “This was a way of introducing private enterprise without calling it that.”

In fact, the term “private property” was never even used. Many of these new co-ops became the basis of the oligarchical system that continues to control power in Russia today.

Gorbachev Relaxes Trade Restrictions

Gorbachev also peeled back restrictions on foreign trade, streamlining processes to allow manufacturers and local government agencies to bypass the previously stifling bureaucratic system of the central government.

He encouraged Western investment, although he later reversed his original policy, which called for these new business ventures to be majority Russian-owned and operated.

He also showed initial restraint when laborers began to push for increased protections and rights, with thousands protesting the wild inefficiencies of the Soviet coal industry. But he again reversed course when faced with pressure from hardliners after a massive strike by 300,000 miners in 1991.

Economic Reforms Backfire

While Gorbachev had instituted these reforms to jumpstart the sluggish Soviet economy, many of them had the opposite effect. The agricultural sector, for example, had provided food at low cost thanks to decades of heavy government subsidies.

Now, it could charge higher prices in the marketplace—prices many Soviets could not afford. Government spending and Soviet debt skyrocketed, and pushes by workers for higher wages led to dangerous inflation.

If Gorbachev faced opposition from the entrenched hardliners that he was moving too far, too fast, he was criticized for doing just the opposite by others. Some liberals called for full-fledged abolishment of central planning committees entirely, which Gorbachev resisted.

As Taubman notes, “His more radical critics would say he didn’t move fast enough to create a market economy, but the reason he didn’t was that the very effort to do so would produce chaos, which in fact it did under [former President Boris] Yeltsin.”

Political Reforms Under Perestroika

As reforms under glasnost revealed both the horrors of the Soviet past, and its present-day inefficiencies, Gorbachev moved to remake much of the political system of the U.S.S.R.

At a Party meeting in 1988, he pushed through measures calling for the first truly democratic elections since the Russian Revolution of 1917. Hardliners who supported this initially believed that the date for these elections would be far enough in the future that they could control the process. Instead, Gorbachev announced that they would be held just months later.

The resulting campaign for the new Congress of People’s Deputies was remarkable. While some Communist Party members reserved many of the seats for themselves, other hardliners went down to defeat at the ballot box to liberal reformers.

Former dissidents and prisoners—including Nobel laureate physicist and activist Andrei Sakharov—were elected, as candidates waged vigorous Western-style campaigns.

When the new Congress met for its first session in May 1989, newspapers, television and radio stations—newly empowered by the lifting of press restrictions under glasnost—devoted hours of time to the meetings, which featured open conflict between conservatives and liberals.

“Everybody stopped working,” Taubman says. “It was as if the whole country started watching television…the windows were open, and you could hear the debates coming out of apartment windows.” In 1990, Gorbachev became the first—and only—President of the Soviet Union.

Opponents of Perestroika

But as with economic reforms, many of these newly-elected reformers used their platforms to criticize what they still considered limited change. And the pushback by hardliners was just as fierce.

In March 1988, the largest newspaper in the Soviet Union published a full-throttled attack on Gorbachev by chemist and social critic Nina Andreyeva. The article, “I Cannot Forsake My Principles,” was likely written with the tacit approval of several members of the Politburo, the highest-echelon of the Communist Party, and was seen as an attempt to destabilize Gorbachev.

Gorbachev’s additional reforms—which allowed for the creation of political parties and increasingly shifted autonomy and control to local and regional bodies, rather than the central government—weakened his own base of support as the Communist Party lost its monopoly on political power in the vast Soviet Union.

International Events Under Perestroika

Gorbachev held firm on a promise to end Soviet involvement in a war in Afghanistan, which the U.S.S.R. invaded in 1979. After 10 controversial years and nearly 15,000 Soviet deaths, troops fully withdrew in 1989.

The Soviets began increasingly engaging with the West, and Gorbachev forged key relationships with leaders including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, West German leader Helmut Kohl and most famously, United States President Ronald Reagan.

It was with the staunchly anti-Communist Reagan that Gorbachev, a new kind of Communist leader, achieved a series of landmark agreements, including the 1987 INF Treaty that eliminated all intermediate range nuclear weapons in Europe. That same year, Reagan stood near the Berlin Wall and gave the most famous speech of his presidency: “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.”

Results and Aftermath of Perestroika

The failure of Gorbachev’s perestroika hastened the fall of the Soviet Union. After decades of heavy-handed control over Eastern Bloc nations, the Soviet Union under Gorbachev eased their grip. In 1988, he announced to the United Nations that Soviet troop levels would be reduced, and later said that the U.S.S.R. would no longer interfere in the domestic affairs of those countries.

The remarkable speed of the collapse of these satellite countries was stunning: By the end of 1989, the Berlin Wall came down and a divided East and West Germany were on the path to reunification, and relatively peaceful revolutions had brought democracy to countries like Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Romania.

Inspired by reforms with the Soviet Union under both perestroika and glasnost, as well as the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, nationalist independence movements began to swell within the U.S.S.R. in the late 1980s.

As the difficulties of half a decade of reform rocked the Communist Party, Gorbachev attempted to right the ship, shifting his positions to appease both hardliners and liberals. His increasing appeals for Western support and assistance, particularly to President George H. W. Bush, went unheeded.

In August 1991, a coup by hardliners aligned with some members of the KGB attempted to remove Gorbachev, but he maintained in control, albeit temporarily.

In December, almost 75 years after the Russian Revolution ushered in the Communist Party era, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Gorbachev resigned on December 25, 1991. And with the fall of the Soviet Union, the Cold War was over.

OFTEN remembered only as the era of the miners’ strike and Maggie Thatcher, one historian argues that the 1980s was actually a revolutionary decade which changed the way we lived for ever.

In a new book he argues that 1979 to 1982 represents the most dramatic, colourful and controversial years in modern history. Here, he explains why...

15 The most dramatic musical innovation of the decade was the Sony Walkman Credit: NonStock

TO anyone under the age of around 35, the lost world of the 1980s probably looks like a very strange place.

Indeed, to millennials the Falklands War, Greenham Common women, Les Dawson’s Blankety Blank, Ghostbusters and Michael J Fox on a hoverboard in Back To The Future 2 — the era must seem like ancient history.

But for those of us who are a bit older, these were our formative — and gloriously escapist — years. From the stirring old-fashioned patriotism of Chariots Of Fire to the tear-jerking alien melodrama of ET — though for my six-year-old self, nothing matched the jaw-dropping moment in The Empire Strikes Back when Darth Vader tells Luke Skywalker: “I am your father.”

Perhaps only now, as the childhood memories begin to fade, can we see what the 1980s did for us, from the shops on the high street to the contents of the typical family fridge.

The first years of the decade, in particular, were a tipping point. The old industrial Britain, where men worked at the local factory, spent their evenings down the pub while women spent their days cooking, cleaning and looking after the kids, collapsed in ruins.

Meanwhile a conservative, inward-looking, old-fashioned society was rushing towards a new world of fast food, exotic holidays, outrageous clothes and gleaming new computers.

In the public imagination, the woman responsible for all this was Margaret Thatcher. And there’s no doubt that she changed the record after years of stagnation. Instead of flinching from change, as her male predecessors had done in the 1960s and 1970s, she threw open the doors, for both good and ill.

But did the Iron Lady really change Britain’ single-handedly? I don’t think so. Look around your home, your workplace or high street, and you realise many of the biggest changes had nothing to do with her at all.

Indeed, as Britain’s first female Prime Minister she was simply part of a trend. By the early 1980s, six out of ten British women were going out to work — a higher proportion than in almost every other European country — with businesswomen such as the Body Shop’s Anita Roddick capturing the national imagination.

But what would these new working women wear? Some dared to go to work in trousers, though not Mrs Thatcher, who told the papers that her Cabinet colleagues wouldn’t like it.

When nine women teachers turned up to their Reading comprehensive in trousers, the headmaster locked them in a classroom so their young pupils’ minds would remain unsullied. And in 1983, a memorial counsellor at Golders Green crematorium in North London was even sacked for wearing a “lady’s business trouser suit”, on the grounds it would offend grieving families.

But with so many women working — in trousers or not — who would do the cooking when they got home? The answer, it turned out, was the microwave. By the mid-80s there were more microwaves in Britain than in the rest of Europe combined.

Thanks partly to TV cooks including Delia Smith and Keith Floyd, the British kitchen was going through a revolution. Out went the steamed puddings and spotted dicks of old. In came pizzas, curries and the ground-breaking Marks & Spencer Chicken Kiev, which cost £1.99 for a pack of two, the equivalent of about £10 today.

The other big culinary winner of the decade was McDonald’s, which opened hundreds of British outlets during the decade. Like many 1980s kids, I remember my first visit — for my friend Robert Greenwood’s birthday party in about 1982 — as though it was yesterday.

We all had cheeseburgers, a grinning Ronald McDonald handed out balloons and afterwards we were given a guided tour of the kitchen. I found the whole thing almost intolerably exciting.

McDonald’s isn’t the only 1980s relic still standing on high streets across the country. Next and Waterstones opened in 1982 and Pret a Manger in 1985, all three aimed at young, upwardly mobile professionals, or yuppies.

Yet even at this early stage you could see the first shadows of the high street’s decline. In 1979 the most modern shopping centre ever seen in Britain opened in Milton Keynes, Bucks, a vision in steel and glass.

And three years later Sainsbury’s opened a pioneering, colossal new supermarket in Nine Elms, South London, with “50 varieties of fresh fish”, “60 different types of bread” and even “fresh orange juice . . . squeezed and bottled under customers’ eyes”.

The chain’s plan was to become “the country’s biggest wine merchant, biggest butcher, biggest greengrocer”, all under one roof. And if small, family-run shops went to the wall, that was just too bad.

What people were buying, too, was changing. Records, for example, gave way to cassettes, then cassettes to CDs.

In music, disco and punk were old hat. Thanks partly to the rise of the synthesizer — and also to a new vogue for dressing up and showing off — the baton had passed to the New Romantic generation, spearheaded by groups such as Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran and The Human League.

Not since the Sixties had British pop seemed so imaginative, so alive. Indeed, even today the great singles of the era, such as Enola Gay, Don’t You Want Me, Just Can’t Get Enough and Vienna, still have a thrilling sense of technological optimism, captured by their ground-breaking videos.

Older music critics hated the New Romantics. But most youngsters loved their new spirit of fun-loving ambition.

“I don’t feel guilty because I’ve made enough money to own my own home,” remarked Spandau Ballet’s Gary Kemp. “It’s only the middle classes who feel that kind of guilt.” And Duran Duran’s Simon Le Bon made no secret of his materialistic aspirations. “We want to be substantially wealthy,” he said. “I mean ridiculously wealthy, rolling in it.”

There spoke the spirit of the 1980s. But the most dramatic musical innovation, launched in Britain in 1980, was the Sony Walkman, costing up to £125 (equivalent to £440 today).

Some people were horrified by the idea of a personal music player — yet Sony went on to sell millions. But the innovation that really changed things and for which the 1980s will always be remembered was the computer.

At the start of the decade most kids’ idea of fun was completing their Rubik’s Cubes. However, when the Cambridge entrepreneur Clive Sinclair unveiled the ZX80 in January 1980 — at £99.95 (£350 today), the world’s first cheap home computer — he unleashed a revolution.

By 1982 Mrs Thatcher had committed to putting computers into every school, while the BBC launched its own national computer project, focusing on the new BBC Micro.

Britain led the world in computer ownership by the mid-1980s, and youngsters were mad on games such as Elite, Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy. At the time, some people recognised that computers would bring a gigantic social and economic transformation.

Sinclair predicted the rise of driverless cars and “wireless devices that would allow us to telephone and be telephoned wherever we choose” — then blew his credibility with the C5 electric car in 1985.

Given that the early 1980s saw the worst recession in our post-war history, with unemployment at almost four million, how did people find the money for all this? They borrowed it. Since people felt entitled to the good life, their new microwaves, video recorders and ZX Spectrum computers invariably went on Access or Barclaycard.

At the height of the recession in 1981, personal borrowing went up by a fifth. Over the decade, it went up seven times. Today, when we’re some of the worst savers and most enthusiastic borrowers in the Western world, I can’t help thinking this is one 1980s habit we really ought to break.

The Spectrum may have disappeared into the dustbin of history, but as millions of us know to our cost, those credit card bills never stop coming.

Tragic events and the terrifying rise in hooliganism would change the sport forever.

The 1980s, destined to become the darkest decade for English football, opened with a portent of things to come when England travelled to the European Championships in Italy.

Trouble on the terraces during the first-round match with Belgium led to the deployment of tear gas by police and both teams forced to leave the pitch.

The rioting on the terraces during that tournament was a sight that was to become commonplace whenever the national team travelled abroad in the ensuing years.

You name a European city and it will have experienced so-called England fans terrorising stadiums or rampaging through the streets and squares.

Domestically, fans of rival clubs fought on a weekly basis as going to a football match became akin to visiting a war zone.

Segregation, police with riot shields and perimeter fencing became the norm.

In addition to the violence and intimidation, the stadiums hosting the games were becoming ever more antiquated and unsuitable.

All were ingredients that went into a mix which was to produce the tragic events that defined the decade and changed football forever.

The blackest single year for the game was 1985.

In March, there was large-scale rioting during an FA Cup quarter-final between Luton Town and Millwall at Kenilworth Road.

A disproportionately large away following, twice the size of Millwall’s average home gate, packed into the terrace and it was overflowing 45 minutes beforekick-off after turnstiles broke down.

Hundreds of Millwall fans scaled fences and police were helpless as they rushed down the pitch towards Luton’s supporters at the other end, hurling missiles.

The rioters then ripped out seats and brandished them as weapons.

Eventually, Millwall manager George Graham appeared to appeal for calm and police dogs cleared the pitch.

After only 14 minutes, the match was halted as the visiting fans began to riot again. The referee took both teams off for 25 minutes.

The game was completed with Luton winning 1-0, but missiles rained down onto the pitch throughout and at the final whistle, the players fled for the tunnel.

Hooligans tore down fences and again ripped out seats, hurling them at police.

Of the 81 people injured, 31 were policemen. One sergeant was struck on the head with a concrete block and stopped breathing, but a constable managed to resuscitate him.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher immediately set up a “War Cabinet” to combat football hooliganism. But there was worse to come. Much worse.

Just two months later, at the European Cup Final in Brussels between Liverpool and Juventus, 39 fans were crushed to death as a consequence of the behaviour of other supporters.

Liverpool fans had been allocated only one half of a terrace behind the goal at the dilapidated Heysel Stadium. Alongside them, separated by a flimsy wire fence, were Italian fans, who also populated the terrace at the opposite end.

Liverpool supporters, packed like sardines, tried to tear down the fence, chunks of concrete terracing were thrown, and fighting broke out. The fatalities occurred when a wall collapsed.

The disaster led to all English clubs being banned from European football for five years.

Two weeks before Heysel, another tragedy took place, but this time it was not as a result of hooliganism.

At Bradford City’s Valley Parade, 56 people were killed and 265 injured as the main stand caught fire during a match against Lincoln City.

The old wooden structure became an inferno within minutes of a small fire starting beneath the seats. In the panic that ensued, fleeing crowds had to break down locked exits in order to escape. There were many cases of heroism, with more than 50 people receiving police awards or commendations.

The disaster led to major new safety standards in UK football grounds, including the banning of new wooden grandstands, the immediate closure of other wooden stands deemed unsafe and the banning of smoking in other wooden stands.

On the same day as the Bradford fire, a 14-year-old boy died at St Andrew’s when a wall collapsed following crowd violence at a match between Birmingham City and Leeds United.

The fighting that day was described by a judge as more like “the Battle of Agincourt than a football match”.

A committee set up by the Government into the troubles surrounding the game stated that “football may not be able to continue in its present form much longer”. PM Thatcher called for hooligans to be given “stiff” prison sentences and her Minister for Sport, Colin Moynihan, attempted to bring in an ID card scheme.

Such was the extent of the shadow hooliganism cast over the game that when the Hillsborough disaster occurred in 1989, there was an assumption that the misbehaviour of fans was to blame for the death of 96 Liverpool supporters.

Only recently has the stigma carried by Liverpool fans for what happened during that FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest finally been removed.

The tragedy happened when sections of the terracing at the Leppings Lane end of the ground overfilled and fans were not able to spill over to the safety of the pitch because of the anti-hooligan fences erected around the ground.

In the aftermath of Hillsborough, there was a general acceptance that terracing and perimeter fencing were not safe and that grounds should be all-seated and unfenced.

With events off the field dominating the whole decade, it’s easy to forget that there was still some football played during the 80s!

Liverpool dominated the domestic scene, winning six league titles, two FA Cups and four League Cups. They also won two European Cups before the ban.

Alex Ferguson arrived at Manchester United in 1986, threatening to “knock Liverpool off their perch”. He won nothing during that decade but he certainly made up for it afterwards.

Perhaps the club that suffered most because of the European ban was Liverpool’s neighbours Everton.

Under Howard Kendall, they won the League a couple of weeks before Heysel but were unable to take on the best of Europe the following season.

On the international scene, England had a dismal World Cup in Spain in 1982 but looked much better in Mexico four years later until Diego Maradona’s “Hand of God” goal knocked them out.

The little Argentine was the decade’s most outstanding player, though Ruud Gullit of Holland and Frenchman Michel Platini ran him close.

No question that in Britain, the best player of the 1980s was Kenny Dalglish.

He became player-manager at Liverpool in 1985 and won 14 major trophies during the decade.

He also played a huge part in steering the club through the dark days following Hillsborough.

Dalglish’s Liverpool were to win the first title of the 1990s, too, but it was also to prove the club’s last.

Football was about to undergo huge changes with the advent of the satellite dish and power was about to shift 30 miles along the East Lancashire Road…"
106300,Those born in the 1980s the first to have less disposable income,https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-7383409/Those-born-1980s-disposable-income.html,21/02/2020,Business,1980S,True,"By contrast, at that age, those born in the 1970s stood to have more than £7,000 more in disposable income than those born in the decade before.

At the age of 31, someone born in the 1970s would have 26 per cent more disposable income than someone born in the 1960s, while someone born in the 1980s would have one per cent less on the decade before.
The improvement in earnings is perhaps the main reason why there appears to be a correction in the generation born in the 1990s; at the age of 27 someone born in the Britpop decade would expect to have £3,000 more in disposable income than someone born in the 1980s.","ons, disposable, income, age, born, cent, generation, decade, 1980s, incomes","Those born in the 1980s may want to look away now. While the expectation is that each generation has it better than the one before, but that has not been the case for those born in the decade that Margaret Thatcher spanned as Prime Minister.

Disposable income growth has slumped in younger generations to such an extent that at the age of 27, those born in the 1980s had £800 less to spend annually than those born in the decade before, according to a landmark report by the Office for National Statistics.

By contrast, at that age, those born in the 1970s stood to have more than £7,000 more in disposable income than those born in the decade before.

Booming Britain? Those born in the decade in which Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister have seen disposable incomes dip

It is the first time the ONS has released official data on intergenerational earnings, and follows a recommendation from a House of Lords Committee.

The data was based on 5,000 families across eight decades from the 1920s to the 1990s, and uses inflation-adjusted data on household incomes after tax.

The data found that those born in the 1980s also had less disposable income than those born in the decade before at age 28, 31 and 36.

Meanwhile, between the ages of 26 and 34 there was little uptick in disposable incomes even at the years where those born in the 1980s did have more of it.

The ONS found in its first ever look at intergenerational income that: 'The same pattern of consistently higher average incomes than previous generations has not been seen for those born in later decades'

In its report the ONS said: 'The same pattern of consistently higher average incomes than previous generations has not been seen for those born in later decades.

'Unlike previous generations at each age, households with heads born in the 1980s have broadly comparable median incomes to those born the previous decade.

'They have also seen slower growth in income between age 25 and 34 years, compared with those born in the 1960s and 1970s at the same age.'

The average annual growth in income between the ages of 25 and 34 for those born in the 1980s was just 1.5 per cent a year, compared to 2.3 per cent and 2.4 per cent a year for those born in the 1960s and 1970s, respectively.

While your disposable income is supposed to grow by the most in your 20s, among those born in the 1980s it grew less than those born in the 1970s

Steven Cameron, pensions director at asset manager Aegon, said the ONS's figures showed it was 'no longer the case' that 'each generation generally had a higher disposable income compared to the generation before them.'

At the age of 31, someone born in the 1970s would have 26 per cent more disposable income than someone born in the 1960s, while someone born in the 1980s would have one per cent less on the decade before.

The ONS said that stagnating income for more recent generations was likely to be influenced by 'several factors', but pointed to the fact that 'over recent years, wages and salaries have fared worse' than their historical trends.

'In the 10 years since 2004, when those born in the 1980s would have been aged between 25 and 34 years, and those born in the 1970s were aged between 35 and 44 years, wages and salaries per head fell by on average 0.1 per cent per year according to the UK National Accounts.

'This compares with an increase of 3.9 per cent per year over the preceding 10 years.'

This likely hit those born in the 1980s hardest as household income increases the most in people's 20s.

Someone born in 1988 for example would have turned 20 right as the financial crisis hit in 2008, which resulted in a 'lost decade' of low productivity growth and poor real wage growth.

In fact, separate figures from the ONS published this month revealed that average pay rose by its fastest rate since June 2008 in the second quarter of 2019, when it climbed 3.9 per cent.

Real wage growth after inflation was taken into account was two per cent, which is the highest it has been in four years.

The improvement in earnings is perhaps the main reason why there appears to be a correction in the generation born in the 1990s; at the age of 27 someone born in the Britpop decade would expect to have £3,000 more in disposable income than someone born in the 1980s.

It means someone who turned 18 when Spain lifted the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 is likely in a much better financial position than someone who saw Germany win the European Championship at Wembley in 1996 at the same age.

One of the other factors that have affected the earnings of those born in the 80s have been benefit cuts made since 2015, which have most heavily impacted those in their 30s

The think tank the Resolution Foundation also found that disposable incomes for younger families were pushed down by the higher proportion of income they spent on housing compared to their predecessors at the same age, while those aged between 32 and 40 have been hit hardest by benefit cuts made since 2015.

Ultimately, the ONS found that those born in the 1960s were the last generation in Britain to have much higher household income than the generation before them.

It seems then, that the generation who grew up thinking 'it's coming home', have ended up taking home a lot less than they might otherwise have hoped."
106306,Climate study finds evidence of global shift in the 1980s,https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/climate-study-finds-evidence-of-global-shift-in-the-1980s,21/02/2020,History,1980S,True,"Planet Earth experienced a global climate shift in the late 1980s on an unprecedented scale, fuelled by anthropogenic warming and a volcanic eruption, according to new research published this week.
It also suggests that climate change is not a gradual process, but one subject to sudden increases, with the 1980s shift representing the largest in an estimated 1000 years.
“Our work contradicts the perceived view that major volcanic eruptions just lead to a cooling of the world.
Second author Renata E Hari, Eawag, Dübendorf, Switzerland, said:“The 1980s regime shift may be the beginning of the acceleration of the warming shown by the IPCC.
It is an example of the unforeseen compounding effects that may occur if unavoidable natural events like major volcanic eruptions interact with anthropogenic warming.”","study, climate, volcanic, regime, shift, major, range, world, warming, finds, change, 1980s, global, evidence","Planet Earth experienced a global climate shift in the late 1980s on an unprecedented scale, fuelled by anthropogenic warming and a volcanic eruption, according to new research published this week.

Scientists say that a major step change, or ‘regime shift’, in the Earth’s biophysical systems, from the upper atmosphere to the depths of the ocean and from the Arctic to Antarctica, was centred around 1987, and was sparked by the El Chichón volcanic eruption in Mexico five years earlier.

Their study, published in Global Change Biology, documents a range of associated events caused by the shift, from a 60 percent increase in winter river flow into the Baltic Sea to a 400 percent increase in the average duration of wildfires in the Western United States. It also suggests that climate change is not a gradual process, but one subject to sudden increases, with the 1980s shift representing the largest in an estimated 1000 years.

Philip C Reid, Professor of Oceanography at Plymouth University’s Marine Institute, and Senior Research Fellow at the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS), is the lead author of the report, Global impacts of the 1980s regime shift.

“We demonstrate, based on 72 long time series, that a major change took place in the world centred on 1987 that involved a step change and move to a new regime in a wide range of Earth systems,”

said Professor Reid.

“Our work contradicts the perceived view that major volcanic eruptions just lead to a cooling of the world. In the case of the regime shift it looks as if global warming has reached a tipping point where the cooling that follows such eruptions rebounds with a rapid rise in temperature in a very short time. The speed of this change has had a pronounced effect on many biological, physical and chemical systems throughout the world, but is especially evident in the Northern temperate zone and Arctic.”

Over the course of three years, the scientists - drawing upon a range of climate models, using data from nearly 6,500 meteorological stations, and consulting innumerable scientists and their studies round the world - found evidence of the shift across a wide range of biophysical indicators, such as the temperature and salinity of the oceans, the pH level of rivers, the timing of land events, including the behaviour of plants and birds, the amount of ice and snow in the cryosphere (the frozen world), and wind speed changes.

They detected a marked decline in the growth rate of CO² in the atmosphere after the regime shift, coinciding with a sudden growth in land and ocean carbon sinks – such as new forest spreading into polar areas previously under ice and snow. And they found that the annual timing of the regime shift appeared to have moved regionally around the world from west to east, starting with South America in 1984, North America (1985), North Atlantic (1986), Europe (1987), and Asia (1988).

These dates coincide with significant shifts to an earlier flowering date for cherry trees around the Earth in Washington DC, Switzerland, and Japan and coincided with the first evidence of the extinction of amphibians linked to global warming, such as the harlequin frog and golden toad in Central and South America.

Second author Renata E Hari, Eawag, Dübendorf, Switzerland, said:

“The 1980s regime shift may be the beginning of the acceleration of the warming shown by the IPCC. It is an example of the unforeseen compounding effects that may occur if unavoidable natural events like major volcanic eruptions interact with anthropogenic warming.”"

Unfortunately not everyone agrees the '80s was a great time for film. After the groundbreaking cinema of the ‘70s, the ‘80s were often seen as a bit of a disappointment. Compared with the serious, gritty films of the previous decade, it’s easy to see why. But then the ‘80s were about something else. While the blockbuster only really took shape in the late ‘70s, the ‘80s saw it in its prime, delivering hit after hit, commercially and critically and seeing top franchises, like Indiana Jones and Star Wars, kick off.

You can read our in-depth selections below. But, after much voting, it's been a head-to-head battle for some time.

In a powerful documentary to be screened exactly 29 years after the Chinese massacre, the Bafta-winning reporter, 72, reveals how she narrowly escaped being shot as the army fired on thousands of demonstrating students. Ms Adie and her cameraman describe how, on June 4, 1989, they ran from the violence with their news cassettes as gathering crowds chanted, ""Tell the world, tell the world"". They were among the first to report on the true horror of the unfolding tragedy in Beijing. Ms Adie's evidence made for one of the most important and distressing reports ever filed during her years as the BBC's chief news correspondent.

During one volley of gunfire, Ms Adie was injured by a bullet which shaved the skin off her arm. She recalled: ""There was a volley of shots and a man cannoned into me. I fell straight over him as he went down. ""When I got up, I had blood all over (my lower arm) and I realised that he was shot and the bullet had gone past me... and as I lay on the ground there were others on the ground around me and they'd been hit."" At one point, Ms Adie ran straight through the military operation to get to her BBC base and was forced to attack three Chinese oppressors who had been sent to stop the democratic protest.

She said: ""I just ran and I ran and I ran and I ran. I absolutely tore through these crowds, being bashed by people, bumping into them, avoiding people, going over dead people. ""I finally made it to the big high wall of the hotel and found the gates - huge great gates - locked. So I went up the wall like a lizard it took all the skin off [my hands and arms]. ""I could see there were figures there, they were either police or soldiers. “I kicked one, I whacked another with my elbow and my arm, I then finally hit one with the cassette. I was out of my wits.""

Speaking about the atrocities she witnessed, Ms Adie said: ""I could see soldiers on the lorries, firing. I turned to the cameraman and said, 'We've probably gone past the point where it's too dangerous to stay'. And he said, 'Yeah, but we're staying, aren't we?' I said, 'Yes'. ""We turned up at what turned out to be a children's hospital. It looked like a scene from a bad movie, the floor running with blood.

If someone died, they just slung the body on the floor and got someone else on the table. Kate Adie

If someone died, they just slung the body on the floor and got someone else on the table. ""I'd been conscious we'd seen no other western TV crews. I knew that the Chinese would deny what was happening... that's why we stayed out. ""I felt driven, more than on any other occasion, to tell people exactly what happened. It wasn't just dangerous, it was desperate."" The brutal protest, which resulted in as many as 10,000 deaths, was later described as the greatest challenge to the communist state in China since the 1949 revolution."

There was a deep recession in 1981 as the government tried to control inflation. The recession particularly hit manufacturing causing unemployment to rise to over 3 million. Unemployment did not fall until the mid and late 1980s when the economy boomed during the “Yuppie-years” of rising wages, rising house prices and a stock market boom. However, this “Lawson Boom” proved to be short-lived with inflation returning and eventually causing the recession of 1991/92.

The 1980s were also a period of ideological change and a break with the ‘post-war consensus’. The Conservative party pursued a form of monetarism and were influenced by free-market economists like Milton Friedman. There was a host of supply-side reforms including privatisation, reducing the power of trade unions, deregulation and lower income tax rates.

Supporters of this “Thatcherite Revolution” argue the 1980s enabled the UK to tackle long-standing problems such as inflation, poor industrial relations and a relative economic decline. However, critics argue the recession of 1981 was unnecessarily severe, and the supply side reforms increased inequality – without any noticeable improvement in the long-run trend rate of economic growth.

UK Inflation

At the start of 1980, a significant problem facing the UK (and other countries) was inflation. In the late 1970s, UK inflation reached over 20%. This was caused by:

Rising oil prices

Wage-push inflation

High inflation expectations

The UK government aggressively tackled inflation. To tackle inflation, the government

Increased interest rates

Reduced Budget deficit through higher taxes and spending cuts

Pursued monetarist policies of trying to control the money supply and meet money supply targets.

However, this tightening of fiscal and monetary policy (combined with a high value of Pound Sterling) led to a significant fall in aggregate demand and the economy entered a recession.

UK Unemployment in 1980s



Due to the severe recession, unemployment rose to 3 million and the high unemployment persisted throughout the 1980s. Unemployment was particularly concentrated in the former manufacturing heartlands of the north, Wales and Scotland.

It was the highest levels of unemployment since the Great Depression and precipitated riots in many inner cities during the summer months of 1981.

See: UK economy 1979-1984

Economic Growth and Lawson Boom

(note: figures show quarterly growth rates – *4 to get 12-month growth)

After recovering from 1981 recession, the UK experienced a long period of economic expansion. Towards the end of the 1980s, the growth rate reached record post-war levels (over 2% quarterly growth – equivalent to 8% 12-month growth).

Due to many supply-side reforms such as privatisation, deregulation and reduced power of trade unions, the government believed there had been a ‘supply side miracle’. The hope was that the UK could now grow at a faster rate – without inflationary pressures.

Shadowing the D-Mark

Another issue in the late 1980s is that the chancellor Nigel Lawson followed an unofficial policy of ‘shadowing the D-Mark’ Keeping an eye on the value of the Pound encouraged him to keep interest rates lower than appropriate for the rate of economic growth.

As growth reached an annualised rate of 4%, there were increasing signs of over-heating; Inflationary pressures grew as firms could not keep pace with demand; inflation started to creep up. There was also a rise in the current account (as consumers bought more imports).

This economic boom was followed by another recession. The recession of 1991 was caused by:

The sharp rise in interest rates trying to control inflation (and keep Pound at same level in ERM)

Economy over-extended by the boom years, e.g. consumer debt levels had grown and they were heavily affected by higher interest rates.

The sharp reversal in consumer and business confidence after the exuberance of the boom years evaporated.

See more details at: Lawson Boom

UK house prices

During the 1980s, nominal house prices almost tripled. The increase was even greater in the south-east and London. The housing boom was caused by:

Growth of real incomes for higher earners

Encouragement of a ‘home-owning democracy’

Council tenants given right to buy

Growth in the number of households exceeding the growth in supply.

Growth in the mortgage industry with banking deregulation enabling more mortgages to be made available.

However, house price growth was very volatile, and after the boom of the late 1980s, house prices crashed in 1990-92 – due to higher interest rates and the recession of 1991-92.

At their peak in the late 1980s, house prices were rising by 30% a year, but in 1990-92, prices collapsed.

UK Manufacturing in 1980

UK industrial output was hit hard by the recession of 1981. This was due to deflationary fiscal and monetary policy and also a strong Pound which made exports less competitive. Industrial production rose in the later part of the 1980s. The 1991 recession hit consumer spending as much as industrial output.

The 1980s also saw the decline of traditional heavy industries like coal, steel and ship-building as UK firms lost their comparative advantage. (See: Decline of the coal industry)

UK current account in 1980s

UK current account since 1980.

In 1980, the recession and decline in consumer spending led to a rare current account surplus. However, by the late 1980s, the UK current account had grown to a deficit of over 4% of GDP. This reflected:

Strong growth in consumer spending and growth in imports.

Decline in savings ratio and an unbalanced economy geared towards consumer spending.

Relative decline in the competitiveness of manufacturing/export sector

UK attracting more capital flows due to London’s prominence as the financial sector. These capital flows help to finance a growing deficit.

Budget deficit

Government borrowing fell during the 1980s, helped by strong economic growth, revenues from North Sea Oil.

Saving ratio

Household saving ratio fell sharply during boom years. But, rose rapidly after interest rate hike in the late 1980s.

The Anti-Apartheid Movement had warned against a sell-out by the new Conservative government, but under intense pressure from the 1979 Lusaka Commonwealth Conference Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher initiated talks that led to genuine independence. The AAM could put all its energies into campaigning against apartheid in South Africa and Namibia and the threat South Africa posed to the whole Southern African region.

Beginning with a conference on ‘Southern Africa after Zimbabwe’ in March 1981, the AAM highlighted South Africa’s illegal rule in Namibia and its aggression against the frontline states. Once again it recast its strategy on sanctions, calling for the imposition of a UN mandatory ban on trade and investment in South Africa and signalling its determination to isolate South Africa in every field.

WORLD CAMPAIGN AGAINST MILITARY COLLABORATION

It worked closely with the UN, launching the World Campaign against Military and Nuclear Collaboration with South Africa in 1979, with Abdul Minty as its director. The campaign made detailed proposals to the UN committee set up to monitor the arms embargo and worked with the AAM to close loopholes exploited by the Thatcher government. The UN mandatory arms ban was a crucial factor in forcing the apartheid government to the negotiating table in the early 1990s.

South Africa lost air superiority to Angola and its Cuban allies and its defeat at the battle for Cuito Cuanavale in Southern Angola in 1988 was one of the defining moments in apartheid’s complex endgame.

SPORTS BOYCOTT

Together with the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC), the AAM worked with the UN Special Committee Against Apartheid to compile a register of sportspeople who broke the boycott and to make the British government honour the Commonwealth Gleneagles Agreement. In the more difficult area of the cultural boycott anti-apartheid local groups and local authorities persuaded artists like Shirley Bassey and Tom Jones, who had performed in Sun City, to pledge that they would not return. But as ‘struggle culture’ took off in South Africa, a blanket ban on South African groups performing in Britain became more difficult to defend. With Artists Against Apartheid, the AAM opposed Paul Simon’s decision to record his album ‘Graceland’ in South Africa with local black musicians. By the late 1980s it was forced to hone its policy, saying that it still called for a total boycott, but that groups that were clearly part of the struggle, like the BTR strikers theatre group, fell outside it.

INTERNATIONAL OIL EMBARGO

In 1979 the revolution in Iran cut off South Africa’s main source of crude oil. The following year, the UN Special Committee against Apartheid sponsored a seminar organised by anti-apartheid groups in Holland to co-ordinate action for an international oil embargo. The AAM campaigned against Shell and BP’s involvement in South Africa and intervened with the British government to stop any significant sales of North Sea oil.

‘SOUTHERN AFRICA: THE TIME TO CHOOSE’

The ‘Southern Africa: The Time to Choose’ conference and demonstration in March 1982 was the AAM’s most ambitious initiative to date. The Vice-President of Nigeria, Alex Ekwueme, delivered the conference keynote address and speakers included the leaders of the Labour and Liberal Parties, Michael Foot and David Steel, and Tom Jackson, Chair of the TUC’s International Committee. Over 15,000 people marched through London in support of sanctions against South Africa. The following day, an AAM delegation met the Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington.

On the morning of the demonstration a bomb blast wrecked the back of the ANC’s office in north London. This was the worst of a series of arson attacks and break-ins directed at the offices of the AAM, the liberation movements and other anti-apartheid organisations in London. In October 1982, an AAM delegation met the Home Secretary to present a long list of illegal operations by South African undercover agents in the UK. It also alleged that Britain was being used as a base for planning South African operations against independent African states.

BOTHA’S VISIT TO BRITAIN

Support for anti-apartheid campaigns was growing, but the real breakthrough came with the announcement that Prime Minister Thatcher had invited South Africa’s President, P W Botha, to pay an official visit to Britain on 2 June 1984. Botha was on a tour of Western Europe and Britain was the only country to extend an official invitation. The visit was met by a storm of protest. In May over 100 organisations attended a meeting to plan a response. The next three weeks saw spontaneous action by organisations ranging from Christians against Racism and Fascism, who held a vigil at St Martin in the Fields, to Kent miners, who delivered a sack of South African coal to the South African embassy. Afro-Caribbean organisations played a leading role; the West Indian Standing Conference held an all-night vigil outside the embassy. The mainstream media, usually hostile or indifferent to AAM initiatives, came on board with a special Channel Four news report on the preparations for the demonstration and full-page features in the Guardian and Observer. Most remarkably, Thatcher acknowledged the strength of the opposition by meeting the AAM’s President, Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, and Hon. Secretary, Abdul Minty. On 2 June around 50,000 people marched from Hyde Park to a rally and rock festival sponsored by the Greater London Council on the south bank of the Thames.

SEIZING THE TIME

In the mid-1980s the Anti-Apartheid Movement was transformed into Britain’s biggest ever international solidarity movement. It mobilised hundreds of thousands of people to take part in demonstrations on the streets of Britain’s major cities, and many more to make their own personal protest by boycotting South African products. It drew together a unique alliance of trade unions, churches, local government, opposition political parties and community groups. And it turned Nelson Mandela into a household name. Behind all this lay two factors. The most important was the growth of resistance within South Africa. The formation of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in August 1983 and the insurrection in the townships in 1984–86 changed the whole potential for solidarity action. Crucially, this resistance was taken up by the media; for a few months in 1985 British television showed South African troops attacking unarmed protesters on almost every news bulletin. The second factor was the intransigence of the Thatcher government. In the polarised Britain of the 1980s, anti-apartheid campaigning became an important part of the wider opposition to Thatcher. The paradox of the mass support for the AAM in the 1980s was that it was stimulated by Thatcher’s hostility. The flipside was that this condition of the Movement’s growing strength made changing government policy more difficult.

Other changes altered the context of anti-apartheid campaigning. Britain’s accession to the Common Market in 1973 brought about a long-term reorientation of British trade and overseas investment towards Western Europe. South Africa was still an important partner, but it slipped down the rankings. Racial attitudes were changing. According to one poll, in 1987 72 per cent of British people thought that black South Africans should have ‘equal political rights and social equality’, compared with only 42 per cent in 1965. Apartheid had become an anachronism. By the mid-1980s nobody, not even Prime Minister Thatcher, defended apartheid: the question was what should replace it – some form of power sharing or majority rule. The British government no longer argued that apartheid was an internal affair: the issue now was what form intervention should take – diplomatic pressure, or sanctions and backing for the liberation movements.

THE UNITED DEMOCRATIC FRONT

As above-ground resistance developed inside South Africa, the AAM established close working relationships with the United Democratic Front and other groups. In May 1984, UDF Acting Secretary Valli Moosa visited London and later spoke at Wales AAM’s annual general meeting. The links were consolidated when a delegation of UDF leaders visited London in an attempt to get Prime Minister Thatcher to support the six UDF leaders who took refuge in the British consulate in Durban in September 1984. From then on, a steady stream of UDF visitors provided the AAM with up-to-date briefings on the situation inside South Africa and the AAM facilitated contacts between the UDF and British politicians, churches and aid agencies.

Just as important was the changing role of the ANC, which had had an office in London since the 1960s. The ANC had always been a big player in the international solidarity movement, but it had been ostracised by the British media. As it became clear that the ANC had widespread support within South Africa, attitudes changed and the ANC developed its public relations skills. The London section of its Department of Information and Publicity briefed the media and produced a weekly press digest. Internationally, the ANC convened a solidarity conference in Arusha, Tanzania in December 1987, with a wide range of British delegates, from Labour foreign affairs spokesperson Gerald Kaufman to a community activist from the Broadwater Farm estate in north London. A follow-up meeting in London drew 400 people. Oliver Tambo held meetings with British businessmen and was invited to brief the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe met Tambo in September 1986. Although Thatcher courted Gatsha Buthelezi and denounced the ANC at the 1987 Commonwealth Conference as a ‘typical terrorist organisation’, she understood there could be no change without it. Behind the scenes she pressed Botha to unban the ANC.i

The AAM was finding new ways to project its image. Ever since the protests against the Sharpeville shootings, supporters had worn its black and white AA badge. From 1986 AA Enterprises produced T-shirts, mugs, jewellery, cards, calendars and badges – all using visual imagery to spread the AAM’s message. The Movement had always produced well-designed posters. In the 1980s its mass rallies took place against dramatic backdrops; these climaxed with the stage set for the 1988 Wembley concert, featuring huge banners featurng woodcuts by the Namibian artist John Muafangejo.

1984–86: THE CRISIS YEARS

All this was the background to the crisis years of 1984–86. In September 1984 school students all over South Africa boycotted classes; at the same time rent increases sparked insurrection in the Vaal triangle. Rebellion spread and the government sent troops into the townships, killing 21 people at a funeral in the Eastern Cape on the 25th anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre. On 20 July 1985 Botha imposed a draconian state of emergency over most of South Africa, and in August failed to make any concessions in his ‘Rubicon’ speech. Ten months later, on 12 June 1986, he imposed a nationwide state of emergency.

International reaction was much stronger than that against the shooting of Soweto school students in 1976. At the UN General Assembly, Western governments joined with African states to pass a resolution calling for mandatory sanctions. With Britain and the US committed to vetoing sanctions, the Security Council asked UN members to impose restrictions such as prohibiting new investment in South Africa and suspending export credit guarantees. Only Britain and the USA voted against. The AAM responded by launching a ‘Ten-Point Programme of Action’ of initiatives which it urged the government to take ‘as a minimal response to the crisis in South Africa pending the imposition of mandatory sanctions’. They included the imposition of exchange controls to enable an investment ban, an end to government subsidies for trade missions and a ban on South African coal and uranium imports. The Programme was launched in the House of Commons and incorporated into a parliamentary Early Day Motion signed by over 100 MPs.

A THREE PRONGED STRATEGY

The AAM’s strategy was three-pronged: to lobby the government and put pressure on MPs; to mobilise mass demonstrations in support of sanctions; and to create broad alliances within local communities to boycott all links with South Africa. In 1984 Labour parliamentarians set up an anti- apartheid group to co-ordinate action within parliament. In July 1985 an AAM delegation met Foreign Office Minister Malcolm Rifkind and on 16 August the AAM released an open letter to Thatcher. In September and October, activists collected 200,000 signatures to a sanctions petition presented to parliament at the start of the new session. In 1986 the British government twice vetoed UN resolutions imposing selective mandatory sanctions, and on 17 June more than 3,500 people came to parliament to ask their MPs to press the government to change its policy. The lobby was the biggest ever mounted on an international issue, organised jointly by the AAM, the TUC, the British Council of Churches and the United Nations Association. Next day, Huddleston led a delegation to meet Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and appealed at a crowded House of Commons press conference for mass action to counteract Howe’s rejection of the AAM’s proposals.

At the same time the AAM took to the streets. On 16 June 1985, 25,000 people marched from the Greater London Council’s headquarters opposite parliament on the south bank of the Thames to Trafalgar Square behind coffins symbolising protesters shot by the South African Defence Force. The following Sunday, Scottish AAM supporters demonstrated in Glasgow. In the autumn, local AA groups held demonstrations in Sheffield, Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh. On 2 November, after Thatcher blocked substantive sanctions at the Nassau Commonwealth Conference, around 150,000 people joined marches from east, west and south London, converging on Trafalgar Square to hear Oliver Tambo, SWAPO leader Shapua Kaukungua and US civil rights leader Jesse Jackson. After the collapse of the Commonwealth mission to South Africa and a month of intensive anti-apartheid campaigning in Britain in June 1986, an estimated quarter of a million people gathered on London’s Clapham Common to take part in a Festival for Freedom in Namibia and South Africa.

Two years before, in June 1984, the AAM marked its 25th anniversary by relaunching the campaign to boycott South African goods. In towns and shopping centres throughout the country, local anti-apartheid groups held motorcades and supermarket pickets. The following year, in an intensive month of action in March, they distributed three-quarters of a million leaflets, including a special multilingual version for ethnic minority communities. The month culminated in a day of action when around 1,000 pickets and demonstrations were organised in shopping centres all over Britain.

At the height of the campaign there were pockets of spontaneous trade union action. In September 1985 Southampton dockworkers stopped the export of a milling machine for Armscor. At Swansea in South Wales, dockers refused to unload a shipment of South African coal. Clerical workers at the British Library refused to process records from South African libraries and passport office workers rejected applications from South Africans entitled to dual citizenship. Portsmouth health workers kept up a long-running dispute with the local health authority to force it to boycott South African produce, with the support of their trade union NUPE (National Union of Public Employees).

COMMONWEALTH SANCTIONS

Ever since South Africa was excluded in 1961, the Commonwealth had been a forum for action on Southern Africa and Commonwealth heads of government were ready to impose sanctions against South Africa at their meeting at Nassau in the Bahamas in October 1985. As Thatcher prepared to fly out, it was clear she was determined to prevent this. At an eve of conference meeting at TUC headquarters, speakers from the opposition parties and TUC General Secretary Norman Willis endorsed a pro-sanctions declaration signed by over 200 British organisations representing 18 million people. The AAM’s Hon. Secretary, Abdul Minty, flew to Nassau to present the declaration at the conference.

After fierce argument, Thatcher agreed to a limited package of measures, including a ban on the import of Krugerrands and new government loans to South African government agencies, an end to official funding for trade missions and a ban on the export of computers to the South African police and military. As the price of her acquiescence, Thatcher exacted an agreement from the other heads of government to send a mission to South Africa. The Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group (EPG), visited South Africa in March and May 1986 with the aim of initiating a ‘process of dialogue involving the true representatives of the majority black population’.ii Convinced that there was no prospect of meaningful dialogue, the AAM was concerned that the visit would give credibility to the Botha government’s very limited reforms. In the event, the South African government rejected the mission’s ‘possible negotiating concept’.iii On the last day of the visit, the South African Airforce launched bombing raids on Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana. The EPG concluded that there was no prospect of meaningful negotiations.

The accord reached at Nassau stated that if no progress had been made within six months, a smaller group of heads of government would meet to consider further measures. This meeting took place in London on 3–5 August 1986. The AAM held an eve of summit meeting addressed by the co-chair of the Commonwealth mission, Nigerian leader Olusegun Obasanjo, and ANC Secretary-General Alfred Nzo. For three days protesters held vigil outside the meeting. Isolated within the Commonwealth, Thatcher was unable to block the adoption of effective measures by the rest of the Commonwealth, including a ban on the import of South African agricultural products, new investment and air links. But all she agreed to was a voluntary ban on new investment and the promotion of tourism to South Africa. Two years later, the Commonwealth set up a special Committee of Foreign Ministers on South Africa, which recommended strengthening the arms ban; at its biennial meetings in Vancouver in 1987 and Kuala Lumpur in 1989 it focused on how to enforce the measures it had already put in place. But because of Thatcher’s war of attrition, it imposed no further significant sanctions.

THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY

Britain was also a member of the European Economic Community (EEC). The AAM’s first contacts with the EEC were with the European Assembly; in 1982 Abdul Minty briefed a meeting of the Socialist Group on the arms embargo. The following year the AAM wrote to all Assembly members on the eve of a debate on the Scott-Hopkins report on EEC relations with South Africa. In 1985 Labour MEP Alf Lomas steered a sanctions motion through the Assembly. But the Assembly had no power over the EEC’s South Africa policy.

For two years after the imposition of the July 1985 state of emergency in South Africa, the European Council was a battleground, with Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands advocating tougher measures and Britain and West Germany opposing them. In September 1986, the EEC put in place a package of ‘restrictive measures’, banning South African steel and iron products, but with so many exceptions that the ban only applied to an estimated 2 per cent of total EEC imports from South Africa. The EEC prohibited the import of Krugerrands and new investment in South Africa, but left enforcement to individual member states.iv

Preoccupied with campaigning in Britain, the AAM co-ordinated a joint letter from anti-apartheid groups in EEC member states to the president of the Council of Ministers in August 1985. At a meeting in Brussels the groups drew up an appeal for tougher EEC action which Mike Terry presented to foreign ministers in Luxembourg at the start of Luxembourg’s presidency. It was not until 1988, partly at the prompting of the ANC, that the European anti-apartheid groups set up a formal structure, the Liaison Group of European Anti-Apartheid Movements, serviced by the AAM. For the next six years, the Group lobbied the EEC, and in 1995 reconstituted itself as the European Network for International Action on Southern Africa (ENIASA).

BRITISH COMPANIES PULL OUT

While Thatcher held out against sanctions, British companies pre-empted government action. In November 1986, Barclays Bank, the target of a sustained 16-year anti-apartheid campaign, announced that it was pulling out of South Africa. It admitted: ‘Our customer base was beginning to be adversely affected’.v Altogether 55 British companies sold their South African subsidiaries in 1986–88 and another 19 reduced their holdings. If mergers and liquidations are included, the number of British companies operating in South Africa fell by 20 per cent.vi New British direct investment in South Africa slowed to a trickle, from 2 per cent of total British overseas net investment in 1984 to 0.7 per cent in 1986.vii

In August 1985, South Africa announced a moratorium on the repayment of its foreign debts and the temporary closure of the foreign exchange markets and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The declaration was precipitated by the decision of Chase Manhattan Bank not to roll over its loans. Other banks and investors moved to switch their funds. Like the defeat at Cuito Cuanavale, the crisis was a key moment in the events leading to de Klerk’s decision to lift the ban on the liberation movements in February 1990. From now on, South Africa’s domestic policies were constrained by its need to negotiate short-term debt packages with overseas banks and its economy was starved of investment.

PEOPLE’S SANCTIONS

1986 marked the climax of the AAM’s campaign to win government support for economic sanctions. When the Conservative government won a third term in June 1987, the Movement’s emphasis moved to ‘people’s sanctions’. It called for boycotts by individual shoppers to be transformed into mass action to stop the supermarket chains that dominated British retailing from stocking South African goods. Tesco and Sainsbury’s became its main targets; they were subjected to regular ‘days of action’, when activists handed out leaflets warning ‘Every bite buys a bullet!’ or piled South African fruit into trolleys and refused to pay. Afraid of losing market share, Tesco pledged that it would stop sourcing its ‘own label’ produce in South Africa. In two areas with big black communities, Brixton, south London and St Paul’s, Bristol, Tesco stores took all South African goods off the shelves. In 1989 the AAM’s ‘Boycott Bandwagon’ bus toured the country, blitzing local shopping centres. The AAM commissioned a special film promoting the boycott, The Fruits of Fear.

The boycott campaign found new targets – gold, coal and tourism. A coalition of the AAM, End Loans to Southern Africa (ELTSA), the ANC and SWAPO set up the World Gold Commission to research gold sanctions. The AAM linked up with the National Union of Mineworkers to hold a conference to plan an embargo against South African coal imports. Activists picketed travel agents telling their customers ‘Apartheid is no holiday’. In 1986 a new group, EMBARGO, was set up with church and trade union support to campaign for an international oil ban. In March 1987 the AAM joined the campaign launched by US and Dutch groups against Shell, joint owner of one of South Africa’s biggest oil refineries and a lead company in its coalmining and petrochemicals industries.viii Shell garages had been a target for local anti-apartheid campaigners since the 1970s; now the AAM launched a total boycott of Shell. Several local authorities moved big heating oil contracts and unions instructed their officials not to buy petrol at Shell garages. The company’s 1989 annual general meeting was disrupted by protesters.

After the South African government’s 1985 declaration of a moratorium on loan repayments, it negotiated a series of loan packages with international banks in 1986, 1987 and 1989. In 1989 the ANC convened an international consultation in London on how to pressure the banks to pull the plug, attended by anti-apartheid organisations from 16 countries. The groups co-ordinated days and weeks of action targeting the banks which represented their countries on the ‘technical committee’ set up to negotiate with South Africa. In Britain the lead was taken by ELTSA and the churches played a big role.

What did the Anti-Apartheid Movement’s sanctions campaign achieve? Prime Minister Thatcher was obdurately opposed to sanctions and resisted all pressure to put in place any meaningful measures. But millions of British people responded to the call for people’s sanctions. In June 1986 a Harris poll found that 51 per cent of British people were in favour of some form of sanctions against South Africa. A remarkable 27 per cent said that they boycotted South African products.ix Fruit and vegetable imports from South Africa fell by 8.5 per cent in 1986, and between 1983 and 1986 imports of South African textiles dropped from £14 million to £9 million, a fall of over 35 per cent.x In November 1985 the Co-operative Retail Society, Britain’s biggest co- op with 800 outlets, took South African goods off its shelves. The South Africa Canned Fruit Export Board commented: ‘Although there are no official sanctions against South African agricultural produce entering the UK … there seems to be a reluctance of buyers to take the risk of stocking South African produce’.xi By 1987 over half of all local authority pension funds, totalling £13 billion, placed restrictions on investing in South African-related companies.xii Public opinion also meant that Thatcher was unable to renege on the arms embargo or the Gleneagles Agreement. Most important, through its lobbying at the Commonwealth, the EEC and the UN, the AAM played a big role in putting sanctions on the international agenda.

RESISTANCE AND REPRESSION

As resistance grew within South Africa, the apartheid government hit back by staging high-profile trials of UDF and trade union leaders, and detaining thousands of protesters, many of them children. Southern Africa the Imprisoned Society (SATIS) and the AAM responded by alerting church, trade union and human rights organisations and asking them to protest to the South African Embassy, especially in cases where trialists were threatened with the death sentence. In 1985 SATIS convened a UDF Treason Trial Campaign Committee to campaign for the withdrawal of charges of high treason brought against leaders of the UDF. By December 1986 24,000 people had been detained under the state of emergency, around 40 per cent of them under 18 years old. In 1987 the Bishop Ambrose Reeves Trust organised a groundbreaking international conference in Harare where participants heard firsthand accounts of detention and torture from children who had just left South Africa.xiii A national petition, ‘Free All Apartheid’s Detainees’, launched in June 1987 by Trevor Huddleston and TUC General Secretary Norman Willis, with the backing of the British Council of Churches and the Catholic Bishops Conference, was signed by 300,000 people. As trade unionists came under attack after the banning of the UDF in February 1988, SATIS launched a Joint Campaign Against the Repression of Trade Unionists in South Africa and Namibia with a demonstration outside South Africa House. The demonstration coincided with the reopening of the trial of South African metalworkers’ union general secretary, Moses Mayekiso and four other members of the Alexandra Action Committee; the trial was the focus of a huge international protest and the five men were acquitted in April 1989.

‘NO APARTHEID EXECUTIONS’

On 6 April 1979 Solomon Mahlangu was hanged in defiance of appeals from the UN Security Council and world leaders, including British Foreign Secretary David Owen. His death was South Africa’s first political execution since 1968. Over the next seven years 14 young freedom fighters were sentenced to death and seven of them were hanged – the others had their sentences commuted largely because of international protests. In Britain, SATIS led campaigns to save their lives. Mourners kept vigil all night outside South Africa House and stood in silence as the executions took place at dawn.

The most notorious cases, involving civilian demonstrators rather than MK combatants, were those of the Sharpeville Six and the Upington Seven. Both groups were condemned to death because they were present at protests where black collaborators were killed. The six were sentenced to death in December 1985; during the two and a half years they spent on death row, SATIS kept up a constant demand for their reprieve. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the leader of Britain’s Catholic church, Cardinal Hume, the TUC general secretary and MPs from all parties protested, and there was extensive media interest in the case. Members of an AAM delegation which met Foreign Office Minister Lynda Chalker in 1987 received a sympathetic hearing, and were shocked when she told them that three other political prisoners on death row had already been hanged. One of the main aims of the campaign in Britain was to pressure Thatcher to intervene; just days before the executions of the Sharpeville Six were due to take place she instructed the British ambassador to tell Botha of her concern. Because of the huge international pressure, the South African justice minister announced an indefinite stay of execution in July 1988.

In the late 1980s, there was a big increase in the number of people sentenced to death and a new secrecy about the hangings. In every case it knew about, the AAM asked the British government to intervene with the South African authorities. But in the great majority of cases, the government refused, on the grounds that the cases did not meet its criteria that there must be ‘extenuating circumstances or grounds to doubt the fairness of the judicial process’.xiv From 1986, SATIS co-ordinated a ‘no apartheid executions’ campaign. By 1989 at least 80 political prisoners were on death row, and SATIS circulated an emergency petition with a target of half a million signatures. British trade unionists campaigned to save the lives of union activists sentenced to death. At least eight more political prisoners were hanged, but as a result of British and international action, and campaigns inside South Africa, many more survived on death row until they were reprieved as part of the negotiating process in the early 1990s.

‘FREE NELSON MANDELA’

The AAM’s biggest initiative of the 1980s was the campaign to free Nelson Mandela. In 1977 or 1978 Enuga Reddy, Secretary of the UN Special Committee Against Apartheid, wrote to national anti-apartheid movements suggesting they mark Mandela’s 60th birthday, 18 July 1978. The idea was taken up by the AAM as part of the activities it was planning for UN International Anti- Apartheid Year. It distributed 50,000 copies of a special leaflet and thousands of birthday cards were posted to Mandela on Robben Island. Prime Minister James Callaghan sent greetings on behalf of the British government.

Two years later the Sunday Post in South Africa launched a petition calling for Mandela’s release. Significantly, this time the initiative came from within South Africa. The AAM linked up with IDAF to launch a new film about Mandela at a meeting marking the anniversary of the sentencing of the Rivonia trialists, and thousands of postcards were sent from Britain to the Sunday Post. A declaration calling for the release of Mandela and all political prisoners was endorsed by over 100 MPs, trade unions, student leaders, playwrights, musicians and academics. The Labour Party took up the campaign by sending an invitation to Mandela to speak at its conference and Scottish miners asked him to come to their annual gala.

In August 1981 Mandela was awarded the Freedom of the City of Glasgow, and later in the year Glasgow’s Lord Provost launched an international Declaration of Mayors calling for Mandela’s unconditional release. The Declaration was signed by more than 2,200 mayors in 56 countries. Over the next few years Mandela received an avalanche of honours in countries all over the world, especially Britain. Innumerable buildings, streets, public gardens and student union facilities were named for Mandela; he was awarded honorary degrees and medals, and prizes and scholarships were named in his honour. The street in north London where the AAM had its headquarters was renamed Mandela Street.

The AAM consciously used the Mandela campaign to try to reach out to new people. In 1983, to mark Mandela’s 65th birthday, it set up a Free Nelson Mandela Co-ordinating Committee to encourage groups to take their own initiatives. Millions watched the television profile of Mandela, ‘South Africa’s Other Leader’, timed to coincide with Botha’s visit to Britain in June 1984. Trevor Huddleston presented a petition – signed by ‘half a million people including an Archbishop’ – to the UN Security Council on South African Political Prisoners Day, 11 October. In a rare concession to the strength of public opinion, Thatcher wrote to Huddleston: ‘I recognise Mr Mandela’s standing in the black community of South Africa … We have made it clear to the South African government both privately and publicly that his release would be widely welcomed’.xv Subsequently, the British government joined in an appeal by EEC foreign ministers for Mandela’s immediate and unconditional freedom.

In 1986 City of London AA Group launched a non-stop picket of South Africa House to call for Mandela’s release; it kept the picket going until February 1990. The protest attracted hundreds of young and enthusiastic activists, and was a constant reminder to the hundreds of thousands of Londoners and tourists who passed through Trafalgar Square of Nelson Mandela’s continued imprisonment.

Music made a big contribution to raising anti-apartheid consciousness from the earliest days of the AAM. The first group to release a record calling for Mandela’s release was the Birmingham rock band The Sussed – they advertised their 1980 number as ‘beating the drum for the release of our brother’.xvi Mandela’s 65th birthday was celebrated at a ‘Festival of African Sounds’ with Hugh Masekela at London’s Alexandra Palace. Inspired by the gig, Jerry Dammers wrote a hit single ‘Free Nelson Mandela’ for The Special AKA, which became the theme song for the campaign. With Oliver Tambo’s son Dali, he founded Artists Against Apartheid, which organised a free rock festival on Clapham Common in June 1986, where around a quarter of a million people listened to a line-up of top UK performers.

‘NELSON MANDELA: FREEDOM AT 70’

Plans for what was to become the most successful of all the AAM’s campaigns were first mooted in 1987. Jerry Dammers secured the support of Dire Straits and Jim Kerr of Simple Minds for a concert at Wembley Stadium in 1988 and approached Tony Hollingsworth, one of the organisers of the Glastonbury Festival, to act as producer. At the same time the AAM had been discussing how to mark Mandela’s 70th birthday. These ideas came together and the concept of the Nelson Mandela: Freedom at 70 campaign took off. Bob Hughes and Mike Terry flew to Tanzania in December to attend the ANC’s international conference, where they discussed the plans with Thabo Mbeki. In its 8 January 1988 New Year’s message the ANC called for the celebration of Mandela’s 70th birthday.

Over the next six months, the campaign took shape. The BBC made the courageous decision to broadcast the entire Wembley concert, and Trevor Huddleston took on a new role as the AAM’s front man in contacts with Peter Gabriel, Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder and Sting. Meanwhile the AAM worked on a wider campaign, to be launched at the concert, timed to mark the 25th anniversary of the start of the Rivonia Trial, and followed by a march by 25 people from Glasgow to London, signifying the 25 years Mandela had spent in prison. The campaign was to culminate in a rally in Hyde Park on 17 July, the eve of Mandela’s 70th birthday.

On 11 June 1988 at Wembley stadium a capacity audience of 82,000, with Oliver Tambo as guest of honour, listened to a dazzling non-stop parade of rock, jazz and traditional groups, singers, instrumentalists, dancers, actors and comedians. The celebration was broadcast by the BBC, which made it available to television stations worldwide, so that it had a potential audience of a billion people in 63 countries – a record number for a live event. It was agreed that the concert would be headlined ‘Nelson Mandela: A 70th Birthday Tribute’, because of an implicit understanding that a more overtly political title would make it harder for the BBC to resist the virulent right-wing attacks on it for broadcasting the event. But as the concert rolled out, it was infused with calls for freedom for Mandela and the isolation of apartheid. Little Steven paced the stage saying: ‘We will no longer do business with those who do business with apartheid’. Peter Gabriel told the crowd: ‘South Africa is the only country in the world to have racism written into its constitution’, before launching into his hit song ‘Biko’. The concert raised the stakes by universalising Mandela’s significance. ‘Until you are free’, Stevie Wonder told Mandela, ‘no man or woman or child of any culture or colour is free’. Dire Straits echoed: ‘One humanity, one justice’.

Next morning Tambo and Huddleston, together with Jim Kerr and Simple Minds, flew to Glasgow to speak at a 15 000-strong rally in Glasgow which saw the freedom marchers off on their five- week walk from Scotland to London. The marchers stopped in 40 towns and cities along the way. In a ‘Free Mandela’ cycle ride, 11 cyclists rode from Land’s End to London. On 17 July in Hyde Park, a crowd of a quarter of a million people heard Desmond Tutu call for Mandela’s release.

Mandela’s birthday was celebrated at a multi-faith church service at St James’s, Piccadilly. The AAM aimed to get a million people in Britain wearing its special ‘Free Nelson Mandela’ badge on Mandela’s birthday and 30,000 birthday cards were delivered to the South African embassy.

The Freedom at Seventy campaign was a huge international event. It projected Mandela not just as the world’s most famous political prisoner, but as the future leader of a non-racial South Africa. According to one poll, a remarkable 92 per cent of people in Britain recognised Mandela’s name; seventy per cent of them thought he should be freed and 58 per cent wanted Thatcher to do more to secure his release.xvii

GROWTH AND EXPANSION

The campaign also strengthened the AAM’s organisational base. National membership more than doubled from 8,500 in 1986 to a high of 19,410 in March 1989. A change in the AAM’s constitution in 1987 formalised a new category of local members, so that at its peak the AAM’s total membership was around 40,000.xviii This was still small compared with organisations like the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament; support was always much wider than formal membership.

The number of nationally affiliated organisations nearly doubled from around 700 in 1985 to just under 1,300 in 1989, more than three-quarters of them trade union and Labour Party branches, with a sprinkling of church, women’s and community organisations. Most important was the mushrooming of local anti-apartheid groups from 69 in 1984 to 187 in 1988, giving the AAM a nationwide branch structure. The AAM’s new constitution reflected this growth, instituting a delegate national conference which in 1987 was held for the first time outside London, in Sheffield.

THE SOUTHERN AFRICA COALITION

The success of the Freedom at Seventy Campaign gave the AAM a new authority within the wider anti-apartheid coalition. In February 1989, a conference organised by the British Council of Churches and the development agency Christian Aid endorsed a ‘Call to Action’, advocating targeted sanctions against South Africa. The AAM’s Mike Terry was on the conference preparatory committee and helped draft the appeal. The meeting was a new departure in that it was attended by business representatives and by Foreign Office minister Lynda Chalker. It inspired the formation of the Southern Africa Coalition (SAC), an alliance of churches, trade unions, development agencies and local authorities, in which the AAM played a key role. SAC moved quickly to try to persuade British banks to refuse to reschedule South Africa’s debt. It represented a breadth of support for sanctions that would have been impossible only a few years before. But as the AAM and SAC pressed the British government to change its policy, they were overtaken by events in Southern Africa.

NAMIBIA

From its formation, the AAM worked for the independence of Namibia, and throughout the 1980s campaigned for an end to South Africa’s illegal occupation and support for the South West Africa People’s Organisation (SWAPO). It urged the British government to support UN sanctions against South Africa to bring pressure on it to withdraw from Namibia. It circulated lists of British companies involved in Namibia and pressured them to withdraw. It supported the Campaign Against the Namibian Uranium Contract (CANUC) in campaigning against the import of uranium from RTZ’s Rossing mine. The AAM worked closely with the Namibia Support Committee (NSC) and Church Action for Namibia (CAN), organising an annual week of action on Namibia and hosting visits by SWAPO leaders. The AAM’s Health and Women’s Committees and local AA groups fundraised for NSC appeals for medical supplies for Namibian refugees.

The Western Contact Group, set up in 1977, held long-drawn out talks with South Africa on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 435, which put forward proposals for a cease-fire and democratic elections organised by the UN. From the early 1980s the talks were bogged down by the US insistence on ‘linkage’, under which Namibian independence was contingent on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. The British government was initially equivocal on linkage, but from 1984 it endorsed it on pragmatic grounds, arguing that South Africa would not withdraw ‘until there is, in parallel, also the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola’.xix In

delegations to government and in memoranda the AAM lobbied hard against linkage, urging Britain to end prevarication by the Contact Group and insist on South African withdrawal. In December 1988, in response to military setbacks in Angola and overwhelming international pressure, South Africa agreed to the UN plan. In Britain the AAM’s President, Trevor Huddleston, and the leaders of the Labour and Social Democrat Parties set up an election appeal for funds for SWAPO. Namibia celebrated its independence, with SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma as its new President, on 21 March 1990.

CONCLUSION

At the end of the decade, internal resistance and international pressure were pushing South Africa towards the negotiating table. The AAM feared that South Africa might use its apparent reasonableness over Namibia to improve its international position and buy support from its Western allies. Its assessment was that, backed by the British government, the National Party’s new leader, F.W. de Klerk, was seeking to achieve a political dispensation which would be apartheid under another name. In August 1989, at the prompting of the ANC, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) adopted the Harare Declaration, setting out preconditions for negotiations. These were endorsed by a special session of the UN Security Council held in December. The AAM’s chair, Bob Hughes, flew to New York to address the special session. The AAM stressed that the ‘pillars of apartheid’ were still in place and that for meaningful negotiations to take place, the UN preconditions must be met. In 1990 there was all to play for: it was clear that apartheid was unsustainable – the issue was what would replace it, a botched compromise including black faces but leaving the white minority in control, or a genuinely democratic constitution."

I was really, really scared.
It is a remarkable film, occasionally revived in film festivals.
But I think Threads is the dark masterpiece for both.","threads, great, real, film, really, scared, think, look, horror, movie, frightened","I have never regarded myself as a hardcore horror fan, although no cinephile can possibly deny the genre’s habitual brilliance and flair. Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby and Friedkin’s The Exorcist are masterpieces – and there is a real case to be made, incidentally, for the first Saw, by James Wan, now enjoying its 10th anniversary. I have been unnerved, thrilled, sometimes shocked and often thoroughly creeped out, by horror films. But hand on heart I don’t think I have ever been scared, really properly scared by horror: and this is despite being a fantastic scaredy-cat in real life. I often describe myself as a lover (of my own safety), not a fighter.



What disconcerts me sometimes is what’s expected of the genre. People coming out of a great comedy will be laughing. People coming out of a great action movie will be whooping and fist-pumping. But people coming out of a great horror movie don’t look horrified – they’re laughing and whooping and fist-pumping. Which of course is fine.

The only film I have been really and truly scared and indeed horrified by – in an intense and sustained way – is Mick Jackson’s post-nuclear apocalypse movie Threads, scripted by Barry Hines and originally made for BBC television. It was made and broadcast in 1984, although the film’s realistic content easily trumped whatever speculative Orwellian resonance was there to be noticed that year. That period was not as tense as the missile crisis of 1962, but after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the diplomatic tensions between the great superpowers could hardly be worse and the ability of artists and film-makers to think the unthinkable had evolved. The government’s Protect and Survive leaflets – themselves a blood-chilling promise of armageddon – had entered the general consciousness: the phrase was satirically transformed by CND into Protest and Survive. I attended a CND-sponsored screening of Peter Watkins’s The War Game in 1981, when it was still banned from the airwaves, and that magnificent film was upsetting enough, particularly its voiceover from nice, friendly, familiar Michael Aspel. But the intense discussion afterwards calmed us all – allowed us to channel and manage our fear.

Threads: letting us channel our fear

It wasn’t until I saw Threads that I found that something on screen could make me break out in a cold, shivering sweat and keep me in that condition for 20 minutes, followed by weeks of depression and anxiety.

It’s about a couple in Sheffield living their normal lives, looking forward to being parents. They try to ignore the preamble to nuclear war by concentrating on decorating their flat. There’s a nuclear strike in the north of England and over weeks, months and years the focus is opened up with a kind of satanic grandeur into the general catastrophe: we see how society degenerates into violent nothingness.

Everyone who has seen Threads knows where the real payload of horror comes, and those squeamish about spoilers or thermonuclear birth defects can look away now. The baby is born in the post-nuclear hell. Beyond pain, beyond love, the mother looks into the dirty bundle and she sees ...

She sees ...

Well, I still don’t know exactly what. I was watching the film with my girlfriend and her sister in the manky basement of a pretty unsafe house off the Cowley Road in Oxford – a setting which seemed worryingly close to the film. At this moment, my girlfriend’s sister gave a cry or a gasp which I will never forget, and walked out of the room. I looked at her, as a way of not looking at the screen, and then I looked down at the carpet. I was genuinely scared to look up. Threads had flooded my body with the diabolic opposite of adrenaline. We all went to bed in utter silence. I have still never experienced anything like it in years of film-going, telly-watching, book-munching, culture-consuming activity.

I was really, really scared. Much later, I remember watching Lucy Walker’s admirable anti-nuclear documentary Countdown to Zero and almost trying to suppress the memory of Threads, to suppress the horror and despair so that I could concentrate.

It is a remarkable film, occasionally revived in film festivals. Jackson went on to direct the comparable A Very British Coup on television, and then more mainstream fare like The Bodyguard. Barry Hines had of course famously adapted his own novels A Kestrel for a Knave and Looks and Smiles for Ken Loach – mighty achievements. But I think Threads is the dark masterpiece for both."

There would be new opportunities in this ‘brave new world’, but those who did not learn about computers faced being left behind.
Surely, then, the greatest legacy of the home computer boom is the high-tech world in which we live today.
AdvertisementTom Lean is the author of Electronic Dreams: How 1980s Britain Learned to Love the Computer (Bloomsbury, 2016).","machines, children, computing, today, games, world, computer, zx80, boom, 1980s, computers, brave, technology","By steadily improving technology, scientists squeezed ever more computer power onto ever smaller electronic components, reaching the point where all the circuitry needed to make a computer could be held on just a few tiny microchips.

In the mid-1970s electronics hobbyists started cobbling together microchips to create the first personal computers. These hand-made contraptions were good for little more than allowing enthusiasts to tinker around solving logic puzzles, but they were a start. By the end of the decade a range of computer kits was available for those with the soldering skills to assemble them. For the less technically skilled, a few American companies were even manufacturing ready-made computers, like the £700 Apple II and £500 Commodore PET. These machines, known as ‘appliance computers’ because they could simply be plugged in and switched on, were more user-friendly, but more expensive too, compared to kit computers that were priced at under £100. For the moment, personal computing was restricted to being a geeky hobby for technically minded enthusiasts, too complicated or too expensive for everyone to enjoy.

That all began to change in 1980: adverts began to appear for the Sinclair ZX80, the first computer available ready-made for under £100. The brainchild of the inventive Clive Sinclair, head of a small electronics company in Cambridge, the ZX80 looked a little like an overgrown calculator. It was a tiny machine, about 20cm square, with a miniature keyboard, and it simply plugged into a television. It offered modest computing power: no sound, a black-and-white display, and its one kilobyte of memory was just a millionth of that of a present day iPhone.

Yet it was surprisingly versatile, affordable and easy for beginners to use. Advertised with the friendly slogan “inside a day you'll be talking to it like an old friend,” the ZX80 proved to be a sensation and sold in huge numbers. It was the first of a series of home ‘microcomputers’ to offer user-friendly computing at a budget price, and a bewildering array of competing designs soon appeared on the market. Home computing boomed; by 1983 Britain boasted the highest level of computer ownership in the world.

Letting the computer into your life

So why in the 1980s did so many people suddenly decide to buy a computer? The answer was initially educational: the spread of microchip-powered technologies in the 1970s brought prophecies of an information technology revolution that would overturn traditional life and work. Robots might replace industrial workers; word processors might take over from secretaries; even professional jobs in teaching or medicine might be replaced by expert computer software. There would be new opportunities in this ‘brave new world’, but those who did not learn about computers faced being left behind.

Home computers were presented as a friendly introduction to a technology that was going to change the world. “We live in the age of computers,” cautioned a 1982 advert for the Commodore VIC-20 computer. “Coming to terms with them is part of coming to terms with the 20th century.” Parents were encouraged to buy computers for their children to help give them a good start in life. The BBC launched a huge computer literacy project to educate the nation, including television programmes, books, and even its own branded BBC Microcomputer, built by Acorn in Cambridge.

It seems surprising today, but learning to programme for yourself was seen as vital for developing an understanding of how computers worked, and empowering people to control them. Across Britain people stayed up late into the night typing in programmes and hunting for the inevitable bugs in their code, as they gradually explored for themselves what computers could do.

By modern standards, 1980s home computers were laughably primitive: machines with rubber keyboards, blocky graphics, beepy sound, and less processing power than the cheapest mobile phone of today. Yet in the analogue 1980s home they were positively space age. So what did people do with these futuristic marvels other than learn to program?

Computer designers were somewhat vague about the end use of their creations, but emphasised their incredible versatility around the home: Sinclair's ZX80 was advertised with the sweeping claim that it could do “literally anything from playing chess to running a power station”. Computer enthusiasts used their machines to catalogue record collections, balance household budgets, store recipes, and carry out other domestic chores, but few persevered for long. In reality, it was probably not until 1985, when Alan Sugar introduced the first Amstrad word processor – a green-screened computer complete with a printer – that many people found something genuinely useful to do with a computer, and they swapped typewriters for the convenience of word processing. Nevertheless, the home computer introduced computing into our domestic lives and paved the way for other electronic gadgets that have since come to fill our homes.

Politics

As with almost any new technology, politicians were anxious to associate themselves with home computing. To the new Tory government the home computer boom was a great British success story that showed the government was leading the nation forward after the discontent, strikes and economic stagnation of the 1970s. The opening of new computer factories pointed to a brighter future for industry, such as in the South Wales steel town of Port Talbot, producer of a proudly Welsh computer named the Dragon 32. Computer company bosses were hailed as entrepreneurial heroes; Clive Sinclair, owner of one of the most important home computer companies, was given a knighthood for services to industry, and Margaret Thatcher even presented the prime minister of high-tech Japan with a Sinclair ZX Spectrum computer as a symbol of British inventiveness.

To the Tories, the home computer boom was symbolic of the new Britain they were trying to create. However, there was more to this than just good publicity. The government invested heavily in promoting new technology and in sponsoring computer education schemes. Many were aimed at children, such as “Micros in Schools” that aspired to put a single computer into every British secondary school. The hope was to train the children of today for the jobs of tomorrow, preparing them for work in a society where computers would be everywhere. At the same time, by encouraging businesses to use computers the Tories hoped to encourage efficiency and entrepreneurship. As traditional British manufacturing declined over the 1980s the seeds were sown for a new sort of economy based on enterprising high-tech firms, financial industries, media, consultancy and other services, more than big factories with unionised work forces.

Game over?

Of course, the computer boom was not all serious – video gaming became incredibly popular. Not only did the millions of machines being sold to help children with their homework create a huge potential market for games, but they fostered the creative skills of programmers to write them too.

The games industry began with “bedroom programmers”, many of them teenagers, writing games on their home computers and selling them on cassette tape through mail order adverts placed in magazines. The games were simple at first, often clones of arcade games like Pacman and Space Invaders. However, the creative freedom offered by home computers allowed games to grow into new forms. From dodging killer penguins and mutant telephones in the surreal caverns of Manic Miner (1982), to 3D space combat and commodity trading across the immense galaxies of Elite (1984), games writers stretched simple home computers to do things that amazed the machines' designers. A new creative industry was born as bedroom programmers started software companies. Many of that generation are still working in games companies today, and even some of today's major franchises can trace their roots back to the 1980s home computing era.

The unexpected growth of videogaming had a profound impact on home computing. It undermined the educational pretensions that had driven the initial boom and made the machines appear as mere toys. Parents became frustrated that their children were more interested in computer gaming than learning, and adults began to outgrow simple home computers and yearn for something more sophisticated. The growing disillusionment caused the market for cheap home computers to crash in 1985. In the aftermath adults abandoned home computers and turned to more serious, ‘business like’ computers designed for office applications, like the IBM standard PC, whose descendants still dominate our desktops today.

The few home computers to survive the crash lived on for a few more years as cheap gaming machines for children, but their glory days were long past as they were replaced by ever-more capable personal computers and other devices.

Yet we cannot easily write off home computers as a failure, or a technological dead end. They helped to establish what information technology could do in our homes, certainly as entertainment platform and word processor. They educated a generation of computer programmers, who went on to create much of the software we use today. More than anything else they introduced the computer-illiterate masses to information technology, preparing people for all the PCs, smart phones, tablets and other gizmos that have since followed them into our homes and workplaces. All this began with the home computer. Surely, then, the greatest legacy of the home computer boom is the high-tech world in which we live today.

Introduction | Collections | Selected links | Photographs

The miners' strike of 1984-1985 was one of the most bitter industrial disputes Britain has ever seen. The year-long strike involved hardship and violence as pit communities from South Wales to Scotland fought to retain their local collieries - for many the only source of employment. The catalyst for the strike was the announcement by the National Coal Board (NCB) on 6th March 1984 that it intended to cut national capacity by 4 million tonnes and close 20 pits with the loss of 20,000 jobs. Cortonwood Colliery in South Yorkshire was to close imminently.

On 12th March 1984, Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), called a national strike against the pit closures. The decision to strike was technically illegal, as there had been no national ballot of NUM members, even though the Nottinghamshire and Midlands Coalfields for example, had called for a national ballot. Miners in Yorkshire and Kent were the first to go on strike, followed by miners in Scotland, South Wales and Durham. Britain was to witness a fierce, hard fought battle involving the government, police, press, and the NUM.

Bitter disputes still remain over the tactics all parties used; the use of the Metropolitan Police in local mining villages, accusations of biased press coverage, flying pickets used to discourage strike breakers (or 'scabs' as they were known in mining communities) from working. As the demonstrating increased, spreading to other economic targets, there were violent confrontations between pickets and police. A key confrontation occurred in the 'Battle of Orgreave' when one mass picket on 18th June 1984 was 10,000 strong and the pickets were met with police in riot gear, police horses and dogs. The strike also saw the holding of mass meetings and great marches as for example in Mansfield in May 1984, when dockers and railway workers joined miners and their families. However, opinion was divided in the face of picket line violence and tragedies which occurred, for example the death of one flying picket outside Ollerton Colliery and in South Wales where David Wilkie, a taxi driver, died taking two 'scab' miners to work at Merthyr Vale Colliery, when a concrete post was dropped from a bridge onto his car.

An important source of support for the miners came from within their own communities, particularly from the women. Locally they set up Women's Action Groups through which they organised soup kitchens, distributed food parcels and organised Christmas appeals for miners' families. The women also actively joined picket lines, were involved in confrontations with the police and travelled the country speaking at political meetings. Nationally, women organised the 'Women Against Pit Closures' conference and, following the 'National Women Against Pit Closures' rally in London on 11th August 1984, handed a petition to the Queen. International support was also evident as lorries brought Christmas toys for striking miners' children from Germany, Belgium and France and some children went abroad to spend Christmas holidays in Europe.

There was much support in the mining communities of South Wales for the strike, including miners from the 28 pits in the South Wales Coalfield, and the Area Strike Committees that covered several pits organised picketing. Other direct action was also taken as, for example, at Port Talbot Steelworks when 100 miners from South Wales occupied three cranes 120ft high.

By January 1985, the strike was beginning to disintegrate as miners facing increasing financial hardship, returned to work in increasing numbers. The NCB had offered incentives to return to work before Christmas. The NUM had failed to gain support from other key industrial trade unions and Nottinghamshire were threatening to form a separate breakaway union (which they later did, forming the Union of Democratic Mineworkers). Consequently on 3rd March 1985, a year from the start of the strike, the NUM's National Executive voted 98-91 in favour of an organised return to work. The miners returned to work defeated but not broken as they defiantly walked behind colliery bands and lodge banners, and alongside the women and children who had provided them with such immense support.

Visa applications are controlled by the UK government and, as part of your application, you may have to pay a healthcare surcharge, also known as an Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS). However, this will depend on the immigration status you are applying for. The Immigration Health Surcharge was introduced throughout the UK on 6th April 2015 by an order taken from the UK Immigration Act 2014. The Home Office maintain that the health provisions in the Immigration Act 2014 support immigration policy, which is a reserved matter for the UK Government. This page has been revised following the UK’s exit from the European Union. Who will be asked to pay? This surcharge applies to visitors who wish to enter the UK for more than 6 months, and require a visa to do so. Following the UK’s exit from the European Union, citizens from the EU, EEA and Switzerland who enter the UK may now have to pay this surcharge. You do not need to pay this surcharge if, for example, you are applying for a visitor visa, health and care worker visa or to remain in the UK permanently. How much will I need to pay? The price you pay will depend on your age and the type of visa you are applying for. For example, you will need to pay: £776 per year for each year you remain in the UK if you’re applying for a Student or Youth Mobility Scheme visa

£776 per year if you’re under the age of 18 at the time of application

£1035 per year for all other visa and immigration applications You will also need to pay this surcharge for spouses, dependent children and civil partners who are coming to the UK. When is it payable? The surcharge must be paid up-front and in total, along with visa fees, for the full period covered by your visa before you can enter the UK. The surcharge will also be applied if a visa extension is granted. Refunds You may be eligible to claim a refund of all or part of this surcharge depending on your circumstances. For example, you may be eligible for a refund if you: work in the health and social care sector in the UK

study a full-time course of higher education in the UK, have a student visa which started on or after 1 January 2021 and do not work while you are here

Staff & Student Update - 13 March 2020

Dear staff and students,

The health, safety and wellbeing of our community is paramount, which is why the University is escalating its efforts to mitigate the consequences of Coronavirus Covid-19.

In line with current advice from the Scottish and UK Governments, the University will remain open and continue to deliver learning and teaching and undertake our other activities. We have, however, decided that the time has now come for the University to suspend face to face teaching.

This will have profound implications for our work as a community over the coming weeks, but we feel that this is the right thing to do at this time. It gives us a better chance of reducing the risk of the spread of coronavirus among staff and students.

The University is suspending all face to face undergraduate and taught postgraduate teaching activities across our Aberdeen campuses from 6pm today (Friday, 13 March). We have been preparing for this for some time, and now feel that we are able to take this step while ensuring that learning and assessment for our students can be continued effectively.

For the avoidance of doubt this means that all face to face teaching activity - including but not limited to lectures, tutorials, laboratory classes, seminars, computer lab sessions - will not take place from this evening. Schools will be in touch with students by 3pm on Monday by MyAberdeen and via email with details of how online learning, assessment and exams for each discipline will be delivered. Students should therefore not turn up for classes on Monday and should wait until then to hear from their Schools.

Undergraduate and postgraduate taught students are now free to travel home, if they wish to do so. We recognise, however, that some students may be unable or unwilling to travel at this time. The Aberdeen campuses remain open, including the Sir Duncan Rice Library and other libraries and computer classrooms, to allow students who need study space to be able to continue to study on campus. Halls of residence will also remain open. We will be making some changes to the way our catering facilities and student facing services operate.

From Monday onwards measures will progressively be put in place to enable the community to maintain social distancing, for example asking staff to conduct meetings online via MS teams. Heads of School and Directors also have the authority to make arrangements for home working where appropriate.

Staff with any concerns about their own health and wellbeing should contact their line manager.

Events and meetings

All events with over 500 people should be postponed or cancelled until further notice. We strongly recommend that smaller events are also postponed.

NHS guidance

Following yesterday’s COBRA meeting, new NHS guidance recommends that anyone displaying potential COVID-19 symptoms - a new continuous cough and/or a high temperature - should stay at home for seven days and follow this advice.

NHS advice on how to avoid catching or spreading coronavirus can be found here.

IT equipment provision

In readiness for this situation, the University has prepared a stock of laptops and tablets and purchased additional cameras and headsets. As stock is limited, we would ask Schools to submit requests for additional devices to the IT Service Desk in the first instance. Requests must be supported by Heads of School and will be prioritised accordingly.

Qatar

Guidance is already in place for our students based at our Qatar campus.

We recognise that this is an uncertain and challenging time for all of us. This period of difficulty will pass. If we ensure that we co-operate fully with national health guidance and continue to support each other, we will be ready to return to normal activity later in the year.

Best wishes,

George & Karl

Message to staff and students from Senior Vice-Principal - Thursday 12 March 2020

Dear colleagues,

In the last 24 hours there have been significant developments regarding coronavirus Covid-19, which has now been declared a pandemic. The UK Government has also today announced the move to the ‘delay’ phase of its plan to tackle the virus. International travel is becoming ever more difficult with far-reaching restrictions being imposed by national Governments.

The Coronavirus Steering Group has taken a number of important decisions in light of these developments.

Staff and student travel

All work and study related travel outside the UK should be postponed until further notice. Field trips and study visits in the UK should also be suspended. We are also strongly recommending that potential visitors to the Aberdeen campus from overseas should delay their travel at this time. Any queries related to this should be directed to coronavirus@abdn.ac.uk.

Those planning to travel outside the UK for personal reasons should follow latest Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice for your destination and for any country you will be transiting through. You should be aware that severe travel restrictions are being increasingly introduced around the world, and if you decide to travel there is a risk that you may find it difficult to return to the UK.

While classes at our Aberdeen campuses are still running, we understand that some international students may decide to return home soon. We will support international students who return home, including putting alternative assessment provision in place.

With countries around the world announcing the suspension of teaching or temporary closure of universities, colleges and schools, we have also updated our advice to our students currently overseas, recommending that they return to their usual place of residence.

Contingency plans for teaching and exams

While recognising that the current advice of Scottish Government is that universities should remain open, there is a risk that face to face teaching may need to be suspended at some point, and that the upcoming exams on campus may not be able to take place, or even if they do some students may be unable to attend. We are therefore prioritising preparations that would allow teaching to be delivered online and assessments and the upcoming exams to be completed at a distance.

Events

The University is closely following advice from the Scottish Government today that gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled from next week. We have already decided to postpone tomorrow’s Live on the Lawn for students. We are currently reviewing all major events including Summer Graduations and will provide a further update on this and other events shortly.

Home working

Schools and Directorates have been asked to prioritise important activities and prepare for the possibility that working from home will be required. Guidance on home working has been created and can be viewed here.

Our colleagues in the Directorate of Digital and Information Services are working to ensure that services are in place to facilitate staff working from home, and that support will be available via the IT Service Desk if you require it. Guidance on the University’s remote access solutions is available here www.abdn.ac.uk/staffnet/working-here/remoteaccess.php.

Public health guidelines

I would also remind you of the public health guidelines to prevent and slow the spread of Covid-19:

wash your hands with soap and water often – for at least 20 seconds

always wash your hands when you get home or into work and before eating

use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available

cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve - not your hands - when you cough or sneeze

put used tissues in the bin straight away and wash your hands afterwards

Please keep checking our Coronavirus webpages and if you have a question that isn’t answered in the FAQs, please email coronavirus@abdn.ac.uk.

These are extraordinary times. I want to thank you for everything that you are doing to deal with the exceptionally challenging circumstances we are dealing with.

Best wishes

Message to staff from the Senior Vice-Principal - Tuesday 10 March 2020

Dear colleagues,

Given the large number of enquiries we are receiving around travel, I would like to clarify the University’s guidance.

I would ask you to be mindful that UK government travel advice continues to develop in response to the coronavirus – Covid-19 outbreak so please make sure you are following the most up to date advice. Anyone planning to travel should ensure they are aware of the latest Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice BEFORE booking or undertaking your trip. In addition to advising against travel to category 1 countries/areas, the University is now strongly discouraging travel to category 2 areas. Please note, this is a change from previous guidance.

If you are returning from an area where the advice from the FCO has changed (e.g. Italy) you should follow NHS advice and contact your HR Partner/Adviser for further guidance BEFORE returning to work. Please refer to the Further Information section of the coronavirus webpages to ensure you are following the latest advice.

Going forward, no international travel is to be booked without the approval of your Head of School or Director. If your travel has already been booked, it should not be undertaken without the knowledge of your Head of School, School Admin Officer or Director.

If you are considering travel, I would ask that you consider the following before discussing this with your Head of School or Director:

Do you need to travel now – or could the trip be delayed or done virtually?

Are you following government advice as outlined under Fit For Travel?

Do you have a contingency plan if advice changes while you are travelling?

Have you got insurance and will your insurance cover any changes? (Note: insurance companies may not reimburse you if you change your mind about travel if there is no change in official travel advice)

Can you delay booking your travel until as close to your travel date as possible to mitigate against any possible change in government advice and travel restrictions?

VISITORS

If you have visitors due to come to campus, please ensure you are directing them to the University’s coronavirus webpages and the travel advice we are providing to our staff and student community. Visitors should be asked if they have recently travelled to or from an area with an elevated risk (category 1 or 2 countries or areas). If they have they should be advised not to travel to the University campus.

The University is regularly updating its FAQs, available at www.abdn.ac.uk/coronavirus, and I would ask that you consult these before sending an email seeking guidance.

Finally, I would like to close by reminding you that inclusiveness is a central pillar of our Aberdeen 2040 strategy. The University of Aberdeen has a zero tolerance approach to any form of discrimination or harassment and I would urge anyone who experiences this to contact your HR partner.

Best wishes,

Dear students and colleagues,

If you are returning from an area where the advice from the FCO has changed (e.g. Italy), you should follow NHS advice and contact Health and Safety (healthandsafety@abdn.ac.uk) for further advice BEFORE returning to campus. I would take this opportunity to remind you that if you are advised to self-isolate you should not come onto campus. You can find more information about what self-isolation means on the NHS website.

The University is still following national guidance in relation to coronavirus-Covid-19 and as such is continuing to deliver teaching as planned. If you choose to travel home before the end of teaching, you should make contact with your School to find out about the impact of leaving early and what you should do to enable you to complete your learning.

In addition, we advise students to consider the following before booking or undertaking any travel:

Do you need to travel now – or could the trip be delayed or done virtually?

Is your planned destination a category 1 or category 2 country/area? If so the university advises against travel to these areas. Are you following government advice as outlined under Fit For Travel?

Do you have a contingency plan if advice changes while you are travelling?

Have you got insurance and will your insurance cover any changes? (Note: insurance companies may not reimburse you if you change your mind about travel if there is no change in official travel advice)

Can you delay booking your travel until as close to your travel date as possible to mitigate against any possible change in government advice and travel restrictions?

The situation is changing rapidly, and as national guidance changes the University may have to consider alternative means of teaching and assessment, which you will be advised on via email if this becomes necessary.

The University is regularly updating its FAQs, available at www.abdn.ac.uk/coronavirus, and I would ask that you consult these before sending an email seeking guidance.

The University will also be providing regular updates via email. Please continue to check your University email account every day so that you are aware of the University’s advice and contingencies should these become necessary.

Message to Staff from the Principal - Friday 6 March 2020

Dear colleague,

At the end of another week of extensive coronavirus coverage I wanted to reassure you - once again - that the University is taking its preparedness for Covid-19 extremely seriously and doing all that it can to safeguard our community.

The University’s Coronavirus Steering Group continues to meet daily, its smaller sub-groups gather frequently and are tackling a wide range of staff and student queries. Extensive planning for a range of possible scenarios is also underway.

Advice from the national agencies still guides our approach and while the situation is ever evolving, our position - at this stage - remains that the University should carry on its normal activities as far as possible.

As we are heeding national guidance, I would ask you not to take unilateral decisions regarding postponing or cancelling activities within your School or section because of Covid-19. Please instead direct questions or concerns around activity to the Steering Group via coronavirus@abdn.ac.uk.

Of course, our planning must cover all potential scenarios, which is why we also need to look at what would need to happen if teaching on our Aberdeen campus was delivered in a different format or there was reduced activity on our Aberdeen campus – should the national guidance change. Communications for students and staff on our Qatar campus will follow separately as and when required.

IF this were to happen - and I must stress we are not currently at that stage - all steps would be put in place to ensure minimum disruption for our students, academic progression and completion of study.

In order to facilitate internal and remote communication for our staff, the University last night also issued Microsoft Teams* to all staff. A shortcut to Teams will appear on your desktop.

While we are not at the remote working point, naturally staff have questions around the virus on a range of issues, many health related. Advice is being sent to managers, and more details will shortly also appear in our FAQs.

We are also reprioritising and refocusing our cleaning efforts across campus with extra attention being given to touchpoints including handrails, lift buttons and door handles.

I would also remind you of the public health guidelines to prevent and slow the spread of Covid-19:

wash your hands with soap and water often – for at least 20 seconds

always wash your hands when you get home or into work and before eating

use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available

cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve - not your hands - when you cough or sneeze

put used tissues in the bin straight away and wash your hands afterwards

Do keep an eye on our Coronavirus pages as our latest updates and advice are being posted there and a reminder again that questions should be sent to coronavirus@abdn.ac.uk.

Dear student,

You will be aware of the heightened attention around Coronavirus (Covid-19) with the first confirmed case in Scotland, more cases reported in England over the weekend and a meeting today of the UK Government’s emergency Cobra committee.

This is a fast-changing situation that we are monitoring closely and one where the University is taking its lead on its approach from advice provided by national agencies. We have established a coronavirus webpage which will be updated daily.

The University has also set up a number of groups to see how best we support our student community with any queries related to Covid-19 on issues such as travel, health and wellbeing and teaching and learning. Questions on any issues not answered by our Coronavirus website should be directed to the following email address: coronavirus@abdn.ac.uk.

Our intention is to continue to operate as normal as far as possible, while remaining in line with government advice, although it is possible that some activities may be affected.

If you are travelling over the Easter holidays please ensure you consult Government travel advice before booking any travel.

As the EU is reported to have raised the risk of infection from moderate to high, please familiarise yourself with the NHS guidelines regarding Covid-19. Guidance and information, including links to guidance for travellers and the general public, can also be found on HPS’ Covid-19 page.

Common symptoms of coronavirus include:

high temperature or fever

cough

shortness of breath

Updates on public health advice for coronavirus can also be found on the NHS Inform website and a free helpline has been set up for those who do not have symptoms but are looking for general health advice: 0800 028 2816.

For anyone planning to travel abroad, guidance can be found on fitfortravel. Where a Covid-19 risk is identified, country pages will be updated.

Up until now, the SEC has followed guidance issued by the Church of England in connection with coronavirus. The Church of England has now changed its advice, and as a result, the SEC now issues its own guidance, reached after taking independent medical advice. Our new guidance from the College of Bishops is set out below.

Continue to follow all public health guidance provided by NHS Scotland, in particular the need for good hand hygiene, and take precautions when coughing or sneezing, which are the main cause of infection. Cease physical contact on arrival at church and departure until further notice, as well as during the Peace which should be limited to a nod or a smile and a verbal “and also with you” while members remain in their pew or chair. Presiding priests should wash their hands thoroughly before the service, and use hand sanitiser when available during ablutions and before touching any wafers. Sanitiser should also be made available, if possible, to servers and anyone assisting with the distribution of communion, to be used as discreetly as possible without interrupting the flow of worship. Small altar linens should be fresh for each celebration of communion. Communicants should remain a respectful distance from the next person on their way to the communion rail, and at the rail. The sharing of the Chalice is suspended until further notice, and communion should be offered in one kind i.e. taking the bread only, placed into the hand. Church members should stay at home and not attend church services if they feel unwell and display influenza symptoms such as a cough, breathing difficulty, and fever. Pastoral support to those who believe they could have the virus should not involve personal visits, and can instead be offered by telephone call until such time as a medical test clarifies the person’s condition. Pastoral visitors to homes and hospitals should observe all precautions in personal hygiene before and after such visits.

To avoid confusion within the SEC, it will be helpful if a consistent approach is adopted across the church, by following the above guidelines.

The advice given today may be updated at any time during what is a fluid situation, and it will also be reviewed on a weekly basis. If there is a significant update, this will be communicated on the SEC website.

The General Synod was scheduled to take place on 11 to 13 June at St Paul’s and St George’s Episcopal Church in Edinburgh.
All General Synod Members, Alternate Synod Members, Diocesan Secretaries and members of Provincial Board and Committees were informed of the decision today, which was described as having been taken because of several reasons.
General Synod falls squarely within that period.
Synod members will be advised of any proposed new date as soon as it is decided upon.","significant, sec, members, postponed, general, staff, virus, st, weeks, synod, welfare","This year’s General Synod of the Scottish Episcopal Church (SEC) has been postponed because of the outbreak of coronavirus.

The Standing Committee of the SEC reached the difficult decision with regret, having considered the latest information available, the estimated timetable for the spread of COVID-19 and the peak period of infection, the welfare and wellbeing of the vulnerable, and the mood of uncertainty over travel and accommodation arrangements.

The General Synod was scheduled to take place on 11 to 13 June at St Paul’s and St George’s Episcopal Church in Edinburgh. A new date will be considered for later in the year, potentially for a shorter gathering.

All General Synod Members, Alternate Synod Members, Diocesan Secretaries and members of Provincial Board and Committees were informed of the decision today, which was described as having been taken because of several reasons.

Those factors include:

According to recent news, the virus is expected to peak around 10 – 14 weeks from now. General Synod falls squarely within that period.

If significant numbers of people have the virus, Synod may be considerably depleted if the meeting were to go ahead.

The holding of Synod would risk exposing those who come to Synod to the possibility of infection, particularly if it is more prevalent in the general population at that time. Some Synod members are likely to be in the category of higher risk and the SEC wishes to ensure their welfare and wellbeing.

If the virus peaks around that time, it may be that there are significant staff absences both in relation to General Synod Office and St Paul’s and St George’s staff. Staff absences between now and then might also be expected. All of these could make it difficult to deliver the Synod from a practical point of view.

In announcing the postponement of Synod now, the SEC avoids a climate of uncertainty prevailing in the coming weeks as to whether the meeting will go ahead or not and it will mean that Synod members do not have to make, and then cancel, travel and accommodation arrangements.

The Standing Committee is due to meet towards the end of April, and it will take stock of the situation at that point and consider the possibility of arranging Synod later in the year, possibly for a shortened period. Synod members will be advised of any proposed new date as soon as it is decided upon.

Meanwhile, the College of Bishops has issued updated guidelines on how clergy and members should respond to the spread of coronavirus, to help protect the most vulnerable. While the Scottish Government has advised that places of worship do not need to close, the SEC is ensuring that clear precautions are being taken in churches to protect those most at risk.

The new SEC guidelines can be read here: https://www.scotland.anglican.org/coronavirus-updates/

Any further significant updates will be posted on the SEC website, and on social media."

Update: Monday 18th April 2022 From today, the Scottish Government has removed one of the last remaining legal requirements in the Coronavirus regulations, the requirement to wear a face covering in indoor public settings. As a result, the wearing of face coverings is no longer mandatory in our venues either for our customers or our staff. Individuals can make a personal choice on whether they continue to do so, however we would recommend that you do so in busy periods. Our signage will be updated to reflect this and we will continue to promote a message of “Give People Space” within our venues. _________________________________________________ Update: Friday 21st January 2022 In accordance with Scottish Government guidelines, from Monday 24th January adult indoor contact sports will once again be allowed in our venues. We will also be removing one-way systems in our venues and there will no longer be a requirement for people to maintain a 1m social distance. However, we will continue to use the ‘give space’ messaging to encourage visitors and staff to give plenty of space to others.

Like all business we are operating in difficult and uncertain circumstances and whilst we will make every effort to maintain our services in line with what we are permitted to deliver, however we cannot rule out the possibility that venues and services may have to close at short notice either through the introduction of new restrictions or as a result of our staff complying with public health guidance on self isolation.

Update: Monday 9th August 2021

We were delighted to hear the first minister announce this week that all of Scotland will move beyond level 0 from Monday 9th August. Whilst this doesn’t signal the end of the pandemic, the removal of most legal restrictions relating to COVID-19 will allow our venues and services to return to something much closer to normal service than we’ve been able to since March last year. Removing some of the COVID control measures that we’ve put in place will take some time to do and therefore we will be taking next week to review the revised guidance and make the necessary physical and operational changes necessary and therefore our venues and services will continue to operate as they have been until week commencing Monday 16th August. We will communicate the planned changes from that date next week. For the foreseeable future staff and customers can expect the following control measures to remain part of our venues and services Good hand hygiene and surface cleaning.

Continued promotion of good ventilation.

Requirement for face coverings indoors outwith activities.

Continued compliance with Test and Protect.

Update: Friday 2nd October

Following the reopening of several of Live Active Leisure’s (LAL) venues, the company’s chairperson, Mike Robinson, today commented on the impact that covid-19 restrictions have had on the local sports and fitness provider.



Mr Robinson said, “We are delighted to welcome our customers back to Live Active facilities, albeit to a quite different sport and leisure experience.



“As with the majority of businesses over the last 6 months, Live Active Leisure has faced unprecedented challenges. Income levels have dropped to almost zero, and fixed expenditure costs have had to be managed over this period. We clearly rely on customer income to operate, but with social distancing rules it is unlikely income levels will return to pre-covid levels for some time.



“Our principal partner, Perth and Kinross Council have remained supportive and we remain hopeful that sector specific support, which has been absent so far, will be provided from the Government at some point in the near future, but as a Board we have had to step in quickly, committing over £1m from the company’s reserves to ensure our staff and venues are supported as best as we can in the interim.



“With staff returning from furlough, on-going venue costs and capacity constraints in place due to social distancing requirements, significant financial pressures are going to continue and it is inevitable that some difficult decisions will have to be considered in the future.



“However, we firmly believe these our venues and services are an essential part of the social fabric of the area, and that fitness and leisure are more important than ever to local quality of life. There has never been a greater need than there is right now to ensure that our communities have the opportunity to take part in regular exercise, to improve their physical and mental wellbeing and build resilience to illness.



“The phased approach to reopening is just one of the measures that we have put in place to ensure that we’re building customer confidence in tandem with laying the best possible foundations on which to recover and grow.



“I am only sorry we can’t open all our venues immediately, but we obviously need to ensure we are compliant with the various guidelines to ensure our customers and staff are safe. We were unfortunate to be hit so hard by flooding after the recent thunderstorms which caused way in excess of £500k of damage to Perth Leisure Pool and some areas of Bell’s Sports Centre.



“We would therefore ask our customers, communities and stakeholders to remain patient with us while we navigate these difficult times, and on behalf of the Board of Directors I would like to thank the team and our customers for their ongoing understanding, commitment and loyalty.



“We will continue to update the Live Active Leisure website as we move forward and would ask you to make this your first point of contact for all updates”.

Update: Thursday 1st October

Following the reopening of some of our venues and services on 14th September, we are excited to announce that the following venues will reopen from Monday 19th October. • Strathearn Community Campus - Lane Swimming, Club Swimming, Fitness Gym, Strength Gym, Fitness Classes, Outdoor Club • Breadalbane Community Campus - Lane Swimming, Fitness Gym, Fitness Classes, Outdoor Club • Loch Leven Community Campus– Fitness Classes, Outdoor Club • Live Active Blairgowrie - Lane Swimming, Club Swimming, Fitness Gym, Fitness Classes • North Inch Community Campus - Outdoor Club • Dewars Centre - Curling and Bowling League As was the case with the our first phase of reopening it remains imperative we maintain a safe environment for our customers and staff returning to our venues. We’re opening to new operating arrangements and it’s our responsibility, and legal duty, to ensure that these work effectively in practice. Initially the range of activities offered, opening hours and the number of customers we can accommodate will be limited in comparison to our pre-covid offer. Moving forward, we’ll take every opportunity to increase the range of activities and services we offer at the above venues. To determine if this is possible, we’ll review the latest guidance from the Scottish Government and Scottish Sports Governing Bodies in combination with customer and staff feedback, level of demand/attendances and financial performance. Over the course of the next week we will provide further detail on the opening hours, safety arrangements and how you can book and pay for activities.

_________________________________________________



Update: Wednesday 23rd September

Following yesterday’s announcement from the First Minister, we want to reassure our customers that there are no changes to our current opening times, available activities and processes. We continue to follow all the latest guidance from the government and sporting bodies to make sure we continue to offer a safe experience for all our customers. Remember to check out our website for the latest updates, venue details and timetables.

_________________________________________________

Update: Sunday 30th August 2020

Following the recent Scottish Government update on 20th August, we’re excited to announce that the following venues and services will reopen on reduced hours from the 14th September. Live Active Rodney – Fitness & Strength Gym

Bell’s Sports Centre – Fitness classes & Virtual Cycling classes

Live Active Loch Leven - Public Lane Swimming / Club Swimming & Gym

Live Active Atholl – Gym & Fitness classes

Dewars Centre - Curling & Bowling Leagues (from 19th October, no casual use at this time)

Wellbeing Classes - All Ability Cycling & Stride for Life walks As you all know, it’s imperative we maintain a safe environment for our customers and staff returning to our venues. We’re opening to new operating arrangements and it’s our responsibility, and legal duty, to ensure that these work effectively in practise. Therefore, initially the range of activities offered, venues available and their opening hours and the number of customers we can accommodate will be limited in comparison to our pre-covid offer. Moving forward, we’ll take every opportunity to increase the range of activities and services we offer at the above five venues. To determine if this is possible, we’ll review the latest guidance from the Scottish Government and Scottish Sports Governing Bodies in combination with customer and staff feedback, level of demand/attendances and financial performance. These ongoing reviews will be completed at three-week intervals, any changes or amendments to the range of activities offered will be communicated through our social media channels, website and customer newsletters. The next phase of venue reopening will include those leisure facilities which also form part of a school or community campus. This phase will commence from the 19th October. These timescales allow for a managed reopening of the sport and leisure offer across Perth and Kinross and will additionally allow colleagues in education to focus resources on ensuring our young people return to school safely during this crucial first term back. We’ll continue to work with Perth and Kinross Council in preparation for the reopening of activities within schools and campus' and will provide an announcement on our first phase offer on Thursday 1st October. Perth Leisure Pool remains closed for the time being due to the flood damage, further announcements will be made once detailed surveys have been completed and guidance is available. The damage to Bell’s Sports Centre has reduced access to some of the sporting areas, but it will be able to open on the 14th September on a limited basis as detailed above. Community Halls will also remain closed at this time unless required for essential childcare services or Food Bank/COVID Response. As is the case with many charities and businesses, public leisure services like ours are faced with significant unplanned financial and operational challenges. From the period of lock down with zero income, to the reduced capacity required to maintain physical distancing when we reopen. These challenges will continue, and it’s inevitable that they’ll impact on the services that we provide in the future. However, we remain committed to tackling these challenges and will continue to do everything possible to 'be the provider of choice in Perth and Kinross for everyone to live active lives'. Next week we’ll provide details on the safety measures that we’ve put in place and following that we'll provide further details on how you will book and pay for activities scheduled to start on the 14th September. Our Direct Debit Memberships will remain frozen until further notice, however you do of course have the option to reinstate your Direct Debit. This goes a long way in supporting us financially which is greatly appreciated and a thank you goes out to anyone who has already done this. We’ll share further updates on memberships as soon as we can. We appreciate your continued patience during this challenging time and look forward to seeing you soon.

Update: Friday 21st August 2020

We’re delighted the Scottish Government has confirmed indoor sport and leisure facilities can now start to reopen and we can’t wait to welcome you back. Live Active Leisure venues will open incrementally from the 14th September.



We are currently reviewing the Sport and Leisure guidance which was published yesterday. This guidance, combined with the huge amount of work already done by our teams, will ensure that we have all the required standards in place to provide a safe environment for you and our staff, while still delivering the positive experience you’ve come to expect from us.



In our initial stages of reopening we’ll focus on a small number of venues and activities, returning furloughed staff and conducting essential preparatory work such as deep cleaning, implementing new processes, and delivering staff training at all levels and on all services. Our initial operating hours are also likely to be reduced as we adapt to the new arrangements.



We can advise that as the Scottish Government have identified children’s education as a key priority, sport and leisure services in Community Campus’ (indoor and outdoor) will remain closed for the time being.



Following on from our recent communications regarding flood damage regrettably Perth Leisure Pool will also remain closed at this time.



It’s certainly been a tough few months and while the challenges are far from over, we look forward to being able see our customers soon.



We will provide further detail on our reopening plans next week.

_________________________________________________

Update: Monday 10th August 2020



The First Minister has provided an indicative date of Monday 14th September for the reopening of gyms and indoor leisure venues in Scotland, however she also stated that this date would be reviewed again on 20th August. Whilst this announcement is welcome news to all of us and we look forward to reopening our doors to our customers, there are still operational challenges to consider.



We have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare for reopening, however, the Scottish Government's specific guidance for operators of indoor sport and leisure facilities has yet to be published.



Details such as social distancing, additional health and safety guidance and the types of activities approved will contribute significantly to how we will operate and our wider reopening plans.

_________________________________________________

Update: Thursday 23rd July 2020

The most recent update by the Scottish Government confirmed that the reopening of indoor gym / leisure venues, has yet to be given an exact date for return, but will not be given approval before the 31st July. In the meantime we continue to work with the Local Authority, sportscotland and a range of partners to progress the plans for the return of sport and physical activity.

“Like many other businesses when we do re-open it will not be as we were pre COVID-19. Physical distancing requirements are likely to remain in place, which will require some changes to how we operate. So, at the appropriate time we will start to re-open our venues and services, but it will be gradual, and done in a way that ensures we attract customers back but also, very importantly, in a way that’s financially sustainable.

""Some of the changes which can be expected include the range of activities which will be available initially, the numbers of customers we’re able to accommodate, how customers will enter and exit our venues including one-way systems and enhanced cleaning arrangements. All of which will be introduced to safeguard our customers and staff and give everyone the confidence to start to return to the activities we know everyone has missed over the last few months.

LAL continues to face financial challenges as a result of the pandemic. The closure of all of the Company's venues in March effectively reduced the Company's income level to zero whilst still having to manage unavoidable costs.

Mr Cromwell continued, “The impact of this pandemic has and will continue to create significant unplanned financial pressures for the Company, and indeed the whole of the leisure industry. These challenges are not insignificant, and in recognition of this a campaign has been launched this week by Community Leisure UK (the leisure sector association representing charitable leisure and cultural trusts).

""Finally, I would like to assure everyone that as soon as we have further updates it will be shared on our website, social media channels and in our weekly e-newsletter.

Update: Wednesday 27th May 2020 - Summer Programme

Q. Will your Summer Holiday Programme including Camps go ahead this year? Unfortunately, due to our venues being closed and limitations on staffing, our Summer Programme will not go ahead this year. We of course continue to monitor the situation closely and will continue to update customers with any information regarding reopening.

Update: Wednesday 18th March 2020 (Last Update: 17th April 2020 - Changes to Term Time Classes Information)

In accordance with the government advice on reducing social contact, we have taken the difficult decision to close all Live Active venues and services to the public from close of business tonight (18 th March 2020) which includes all services delivered in the community. We expect th e closure to continue until after the Easter Holidays, but we will be keeping the situation under review and acting in line with any further government advice.

These are very challenging times for everyone , and we appreciate your understanding and support. We are looking at ways that we can help you stay active over the next few weeks and will continue to post updates on our website and our social media. We’ve put together the most common questions we’ve been asked so far and those that we think you might have based on this update. Q. How will my Direct Debit membership be affected? All Direct Debit membership payments includ ing Fitness, Energy, Fun and Swimming will have a freeze ap p lied which will be applied from Monday 16 th March 2020. This will be lifted automatically once we reopen and payments readjusted accordingly. You do not need to make any adjustments at the bank .

Q. I have an annual membership, how are they affected? Anyone with an annually paid membership for Fitness, Energy or Fun will have an extension automatically a dd ed to their renewal date once we reopen . This will also be applied from Monday 16 th March 2020.

Q. Will my child ’ s one - to - one swimming lessons be affected? These lessons will resume at a later date and ther efore a ll one - to - one s wimming lessons , which have been pre-paid will be credited to use once we reopen.

Q. I had booked my child in for next term and have made a payment which I'd like refunded to me, is this possible?

We appreciate some of you may want a refund however due to limited resource and refunds of cash payments not being possible at this time as our venues are closed, we will therefore not be able to issue refunds until our venues reopen.

We would also like to advise that if you request a refund this will mean your child will lose their place and a request to rejoin the class may mean they go onto a waiting list.

Q. I didn't have time to complete payment for rebooking before your venues closed, what happens now? We will automatically enroll your child into the August to October term, however we will require payment to confirm the space. Payment won't be required until we reopen and we'll email you in advance to notify you of deadlines for this. Q. My child no longer wants to continue with their term time class, how do I cancel? You can contact us by emailing This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. and we will remove them from the class. If you require a refund, we will issue this once our venues reopen. Q. Do you have any tips on how to keep my child active and fit while your venues are closed? Yes, we have created an 'At Home Hub' on our website with plenty of guides and resources to help you keep your child active. We also recommend following our social media pages, especially Live Active Leisure and Live Active Sport. Gymnasts and Wee Springers can also keep updated by following the Live Active Gymnastics Facebook Group. Q. I would like to hire out some gym / sports equipment, can I do this? While we appreciate our equipment is currently not being used, our venues are closed to everyone including our staff and loaning any equipment out would be a breach of both our insurance and warranty agreements. If you'd like any guidance on alternative exercises you can do at home, drop our Fitness Team an email at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. .

Q. I have a block booking in one of your venues, do we still have to pay? We’re removing all block booking from Monday 16 th March until after the Easter holida ys , which will mean no invoices will be generated. You do not need to do anything at this time, and we will update you as soon as we have a confirmed reopening date. Q. My child is booked for Easter Holiday activities, how is that affected? Unfortunately , these sessions will be cancelled. We will be refunding all customers who have pre-paid for an activity such as a camp over the Easter holidays. Our venue teams are dealing with a significant number of enquiries, we therefore ask that customers bear with us at th is time and we will communicate a process for all refunds as soon as possible.

_________________________________________________

Update: Tuesday 17th March 2020

We continue to follow government advice during these unprecedented and challenging times. The latest government advice is to ‘avoid all pubs, clubs and theatres’. At this time we have not been given any directive to close our venues.

However, Perth & Kinross Council have advised that Campus facilities will close to the public from 18:00 on Tuesday 17th March and will not reopen until after the Easter holidays at the earliest. This move is intended to reduce the number of external visitors who come into contact with school staff and pupils. As such, our facilities within North Inch Community Campus, Strathearn Community Campus, Breadalbane Community Campus, Loch Leven Community Campus, Blairgowrie Community Campus, Live Active Blairgowrie and Glenearn Community Campus will be closed from 18:00 today (17th March 2020). We understand that these closures affect the services we deliver in these venues including Holiday Programmes, Term Time Classes and Memberships. It will take time for us to contact affected customers so please bear with us.

All other Live Active venues will remain open as normal with continued increased measures on cleanliness and personal hygiene, to protect both our customers and staff. However, if you feel unwell or have any of the symptoms please refer to NHS information and do not attend our venues.

Further updates will be posted on our websites and Social Media channels

That is an increase of 24 from yesterday's figure of 171.

The update came as part of the Scottish Government's 2pm daily announcement regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.

Greater Glasgow remains the NHS board in the country with the highest cases, jumping again from 44 to 49.

The total number of people in Scotland who have died as a result of the virus has risen to two.

The elderly patient, being treated in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, had underlying health conditions.

Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood said: “I am very saddened to report that an elderly patient with underlying health conditions, who has tested positive for coronavirus, has died. They were being treated by the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board.

“I offer my deepest condolences to their friends and family at this difficult time. No further information will be available to protect patient confidentiality.”

Elsewhere, in Lanarkshire the number of cases has risen from 20 to 21.

Earlier, Nicola Sturgeon warned we are “on the cusp of a rapid acceleration”, as she urged the public to follow advice about reducing social contact.

The First Minister said she was being “frank and transparent” with people about the need to reduce non-essential contact with others, with the latest advice to avoid pubs, restaurants and public events.

Expressing “enormous sympathy” for businesses affected by the measures, Ms Sturgeon said “every penny” of extra funding from Westminster would go to helping businesses and public services cope with the pandemic.

The latest advice is that people showing symptoms of Covid-19 – namely a persistent cough or a fever – should self-isolate for 14 days, along with every member of their household, in addition to urging people to “socially distance”.

On Tuesday morning, Ms Sturgeon told the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland that the policies and advice were being guided “by the best scientific and medical expertise” but that the virus was spreading faster than expected.

Addressing the measures announced on Monday, Ms Sturgeon said: “What changed yesterday, is that the speed and the extent of the spread is beyond what had previously been anticipated.

“That is particularly true now in London, but all of us are on the cusp of a rapid acceleration and that is why the measures that were announced yesterday represent such a step up in the actions that are being advised.”

Explaining the current guidance, Ms Sturgeon said: “We’re asking the general population to significantly reduce their social interaction, so if you are able work from home, do.

“Don’t go to the pub, cinema or theatre in the way that you would normally do. Avoid unnecessary travel, stay at home more than you would otherwise do.

“That advice is to the general public, but the advice is particularly strong for people over 70 and also for people who have underlying health conditions for which they would get the flu vaccine in a usual year, and also for pregnant women.”

Update on #coronavirus testing



As of 2pm today 5246 Scottish tests have concluded



5051 confirmed negative

195 positive

Those with immune system problems will be receiving “tailored information directly”, Ms Sturgeon added.

She said: “I want to be very clear with people, we are considering all of these things incredibly carefully.

“None of these are easy judgements to take.

“We will not always get these things right, but we will strive to get them as right as we possibly can in a very difficult situation, being guided by the best possible scientific advice, applying judgement to that and doing everything we can to keep the public as a whole – particularly those who are most vulnerable – as safe as we possibly can.”

Ms Sturgeon said it is “inevitable that we will see significant additional measures taken”.

She added: “I give a guarantee that every penny of additional that is announced by the Treasury as far as Scotland is concerned will be passed on to those who need that.”"

“Blowing vapour out is as good as someone spitting in your face.

“The vapour itself contains respiratory droplets including saliva, mucus and bacteria and when it’s blown out, it travels for a long distance and hangs in the air at head height.

“If anyone has the coronavirus and are vaping, they’d be spreading it to a lot of people at the same time.”

Tom, who has worked in the industry for nearly three decades, also told of how the properties of the vapour also cause a weakened immune system, despite ex-smokers turning to the electronic cigarettes as a safer option.

He said: “It has been proven that vaping causes an increase in illnesses such as colds and flu.

“Nicotine in both vapes and cigarettes paralyses small hairs in your body that cleans out the toxins.

While Tom isn’t calling on an outright ban on vapes, he is asking that users take into consideration others around them before taking a puff.

“If you’re in a large crowd, move out to the edge of the crowd to have a smoke. If you’re at home, be aware of who is around about you.

“It’s not about an outright ban of vaping but it’s about being responsible in when and where you’re vaping, and how many people are about when you are doing it.”"

Ms Sturgeon spoke to NHS 24 staff at the Golden Jubilee Hospital yesterday and said Scotland was well prepared, wishing patients and their families a speedy recovery.

She said: ""I want to thank staff here for all their hard work to answer questions about coronavirus and keep the public informed.

“As the number of positive cases in Scotland increases, it is vital people stay up to date with the latest health and travel advice on NHS Inform, as well as following basic hygiene precautions, such as washing hands frequently, not touching their face and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.”

Dr Calderwood also said today the country was ready to deal with the infection and minimise the risk to the public.

She said: ""Clinicians are now conducting contact tracing, the process of gathering details of the places those who have tested positive visited and the people they have been in contact with.

""Close contact involves either face-to-face contact or spending more than 15 minutes within two metres of an infected person. The risk is very low in situations where someone may have passed a patient on the street or in a shop.

""Health protection teams will contact those who are at risk from the current cases - those who are not contacted are not at risk.

""We can all play our part to limit the spread of the virus by washing our hands frequently for 20 seconds, as well as always carrying tissues and using them to catch coughs and sneezes, then putting the tissue in a bin, and don't touch your face."""

Their report, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that, on average, it takes around five days for symptoms of Covid-19 to develop.

They also found that 97 per cent of all people who get the virus will develop symptoms within 11 days after they were first infected.

The report said that the current government advice, which tells people suspected of having the disease to self-isolate for 14 days, is “well supported by the evidence”, and that “the estimates presented here can help public health officials to set rational and evidence-based COVID-19 control policies.”

What are the symptoms of Covid-19?

The Covid-19 strain of coronavirus, which has already infected more than 119,000 people around the world, has three main symptoms:

A dry cough

Fever

Breathing difficulties (in more severe cases)

Who is worst affected by coronavirus?

As with other viruses, like the flu, some groups will be worse affected than others. Older people, and those with pre-existing conditions, are at greater risk of dying from Covid-19.

This is because those groups are likely to have weaker respiratory systems - one of the main areas of the body that the virus attacks.

In contrast, healthy toddlers and children seem to be only very mildly affected by the virus, according to the World Health Organisation.

Figures from China, where the vast majority of Covid-19 cases have been reported, also suggest a difference in the rate of death in men and women.

According to cases in the country, 2.8 per cent of men who contract the virus die from it, in contrast to only 1.7 per cent of women.

But health officials have cast doubt on the relevance of this result for the wider world, pointing out that smoking is much more prevalent among men than women in China, and causes respiratory conditions that significantly increase the risk of complications with Covid-19.

How can I protect myself from coronavirus?

The most effective ways to prevent the spread of coronavirus is to:

Avoid close contact with sick people

Try not to touch your face with unwashed hands

Use tissues to catch sneezes and coughs, and put them in the bin and wash your hands straight away

You should wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds

“But in the next town, 10/15 minutes away, they have two people with the virus and they are in home containment.

Helen Irving Dal Cin is in lockdown at her home in Cison di Valmarino in the northern Treviso region.

Speaking from there on Wednesday night, she said: “There is no going to work, except certain factories, such as food production; you can only leave your home to go to supermarkets and pharmacies or for medical/dental emergencies; and you must carry a certificate of clearance to even do those. Everyone is to stay at home.”

Former Dumfries College student Helen and husband Andrea live in an protected area, 45 minutes from Venice, surrounded by vineyards and mountains. She told DNG Media: “No-one in my town has yet contracted the virus, however we are pretty isolated anyway. Here, everyone’s job is working the fields by hand. The only people who pass by are, cyclists, runners/walkers/hikers, motorbikers. “But in the next town, 10/15 minutes away, they have two people with the virus and they are in home containment.

“We have a family friend from the city Treviso itself, who has caught the virus. He has now been in hospital six days and is recovering well and should make a full recovery. But when he is released from hospital he will remain in home containment for another two weeks.”

She revealed that Italy’s first cases started emerging around New Year and said: “This prompted a general awareness that Covid-19 was now in the country and on the news people were told if you have a fever of 37.5 or above, go get tested. So things were kind of under control. The initial lockdown started around mid February. That’s when the crazy started to happen. Schools closed, public places, concerts/sporting events postponed, churches limited to private services. Public services, such as trains, buses, airports were limited too.”

And earlier this week the situation worsened with the borders closed, weddings and funerals cancelled, businesses voluntarily closing and police road blocks put in place. Helen said: “The virus has increased at an alarming rate in just a few days, which is prompting the Government to try and do something. As of yet we will remain in lockdown until the 3rd of April, then the situation will be reviewed again. Until then we just have to wait.”

The situation has disrupted her plans to start a guesthouse, as well as a trip back to Annan later this month to celebrate her mum’s birthday. But she is philosophical and said: “I hope it steers clear of Dumfriesshire. I have my family and friends in Annan and are more concerned for them than myself!”

Describing the public mentality, Helen said there was initial fear and panic buying but now most people are voluntarily staying at home and being sensible: After the initial shock and people not being able to do the normal, a profound sense of peace has started. People are being more considerate, families are spending time with each other as kids aren’t at school.”

And she offered advice to residents here, saying: “It is scary and the world’s media is making this sound like the apocalypse. But after living in the middle of it, I would just say try not to panic, use good judgement, look after yourself, but think about others around you who may be in a harder situation. They may be immune suppressed, or have a health problem you don’t know about. “Buy an extra bottle of soap, but you don’t need 20. Carry one hand sanitiser or a pack of disinfectant wipes.

Just after 2 pm today, a spokesman for Dumfries and Galloway Health and Social Care Partnership revealed that the government figures won’t be amended until 2 pm tomorrow (Weds), but he said: “As it stands at present there is not a confirmed case of COVID-19 within Dumfries and Galloway.”

So far, 50 tests have taken place locally and the potential case surfaced at the start of the week but has now been categorically ruled out after further testing.

Explaining more, the spokesman said: “The situation is that we had an initial test which pointed towards being positive but was not conclusive. This prompted a retest, which conclusively stated that this not coronavirus.”

· A spectre certainly is haunting the planet with the rapidly escalating Covid-19 crisis, with countries in lockdown, pillars of today’s supposedly free market utopia such as airlines seeking state aid and emerging divisions now in public view on the way ahead.

As I write the quasi eugenics of “herd immunity” which potentially menaced thousands of lives appear to be being dropped by UK ministers but the prospect of “isolation” for over-70s – backed by police powers – remains live.

The way ahead, its likely outcome, success or failure however is a different debate and one simply mentioned here as the background to what looks increasingly likely to be a crisis which will liberate a flock of rather unpleasant ecological,economic and social genies and in turn constitute a window on the reality of the neoliberal world order worshipped by politicians for thirty plus years.

Much has been made – often in a barely concealed racist tone – of the “exotic” food on sale at the Wuhan market which appears to be the original source.

“The typical market in China has fruits and vegetables, butchered beef, pork and lamb, whole plucked chickens — with heads and beaks attached — and live crabs and fish, spewing water out of churning tanks. Some sell more unusual fare, including live snakes, turtles and cicadas, guinea pigs, bamboo rats, badgers, hedgehogs, otters, palm civets, even wolf cubs,” ran one report

On the other hand, only 41 per cent of these positive samples were found in market streets where the wildlife were housed. A quarter of those originally infected never visited the Wuhan market or appeared directly exposed. The earliest case was identified before the market was hit.

Other infected marketers trafficked in pigs alone, a livestock species that expresses a common vulnerable molecular receptor leading some experts to suggest this as the source for the new coronavirus.

However irrespective of this debate there is no question that the 21st century has seen a recurring series of diseases – SARS, bird flu HSN2 and other variants and there is growing evidence that this is linked to the model of industrialised agriculture which breeds animals to fatten and be killed quickly with low priority to their resistance to disease.

Thousands of animals crammed together in so called “feed lots” producing both cheap meat and, alongside them actual lagoons of excrement.

Antibiotics are routinely used to counter infection and this process is a contributing factor to the weakening of the effectiveness of such drugs for combating disease in humans. This is the process which pitilessly exploits animal as commodities, feeds people unhealthy foods leading to an obesity epidemic then blamed on consumers.

Of course cheer leaders for neoliberalism hail the cheap food – step forward chlorinated chicken – but are happy to blame those made ill by it for the ill health it causes.

When – as now – the virus comes home to roost society is expected to pick up the human, medical and economic costs. Yet nothing is said of the 10 years of austerity that has slashed the services needed for this task and the vital human skills that deliver them.

Once again, as in the banking crisis in 2008, the idea that the all wise market will solve all problems has shown to be entirely false with profits firmly kept in coffers of the capitalists including squillions made in PFI from the NHS while massive hand outs from the public met their losses.

Indeed the immediate step of repudiating PFI style deals which rip off vital services like the NHS would both contribute to restoring resources to it and clearly spell out the message that such immoral profiteering has had its day.

Perhaps the most striking and immediate impact of the gathering crisis will be faced by, as usual, the working class and in particular the estimated 4.7 million UK workers covered by the so called “gig” economy. According to the fables of the free marketeers these workers are set free to suit themselves and act as businesses.

Yet the thousands who rely on food banks face the threat of real hunger as donations slow and those “free” gig workers are told to apply for the totally discredited Universal Credit currently facing at least a 5 week wait for money.

It seems certain that that wait will lengthen as the crisis bites.

Of course the spotlight of Covid-19 has fallen on the reality of a world of thousands without sick pay, employment rights or other protections.

It is yet to be seen if forcing their situation into public view impacts on conditions long term but it has set Tory ministers on the back foot scurrying to find a way to pay gig workers in order to keep them at home.

As airlines such as the reprehensible Richard Branson’s Virgin and BA hold out their hands for billions to keep them alive to trash the planet and resume the profit flow after the crisis perhaps they ought to be given the same “market know best” lesson preached to the rest of us the last 40 years and told that the state which is paying their bills is keeping their assets.

As a direct result of the Covid-19 crisis the policies and ideas of neoliberalism which has elevated profit to the centre of the temple and pounded people with a harsh “mind thyself’ individualism are now under a powerful spotlight and needs to pushed into the firing line.

We may be facing a moment when, as Lenin wrote, “There are decades when nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.”

The essence of neoliberalism which puts a relentless pursuit of profit ahead of all else, treats living animals as units of profits and closes factories in one part of the planet only to exploit quasi slave labour elsewhere to produce its supposedly “liberating” technologies with their veneer of modernity.

Of course not mentioned by the army of PR people advertising gurus and assorted breathless boosters of this brave new world is the child labour manufacturing the throwaway fast fashion or working in gulag barracks manufacturing components for tech which monitors the contents of your fridge.

Truly we live in a world dominated by exploitation and misery to sustain an illusion of ever increasing wonder and wealth justifying super profits which now faces a brutal collision with its own frailty as the virus spreads.

Alongside standing in solidarity with those in key services such as the NHS facing the storm and taking care of ourselves and those around us socialists also need to study, discuss and campaign on the heavy social, ecological and human costs of neoliberalism and the need for an alternative meeting the needs of people and planet."

Maggie Thatcher’s policy of ‘me first’ has well and truly matured. It is not a pretty sight.

Thanks to the UK parliaments lack of leadership and over reporting by media of scare stories from other countries, some people have shown their true colours. Yes, they may be panicked but that is still no excuse for the way they are behaving. Last night I read a comment on social media that a woman was buying gluten free products because the shelves were empty of the normal product. When challenged she said the coeliacs could go eat vegetables and rice as she needed food. Why could she not go get vegetables and rice and leave the gluten free for those who need it? This morning I read a post that a young mum could not get gluten free food for her son as the shelves had been cleared. She had to ask the doctor if she could get an early prescription for bread, pasta etc.

Given that our predecessors lived through the war on a weekly ration of food that some gannets could devour in one day, I think we all need to take a look at ourselves. I think the chef and the greengrocer from that tv programme could be doing with going into a lot of our kitchens and telling us what we don’t need to be in there. Some people are having to do without and there is no need. Most of the big supermarkets do home delivery and will continue to do so through this period. Community groups are offering to fetch shopping, medicines etc for those who cannot go out. Small cafes and restaurants are offering to deliver cooked meals. Many of us are keeping an eye on our neighbours. You may have to go without a favourite snack but you will not starve!

What is going to happen inevitably, if this goes on for many weeks, is that some small businesses will fold. We have a huge amount of eating places that just will not get the footfall as people are working from home and we are being advised not to gather in numbers. Some may be able to survive by delivering meals to homes if the demand is there, but some are just not going to make it as overheads are huge. What the UK government is offering in help seems to be a loan to keep staff paid but this will have to be paid back further down the line. If the profit is not coming in, this will make it just too hard to find the money to pay back the loan.

Meanwhile, as we are advised not to gather in large numbers, a large number of privileged older people are gathering in the Lords at Westminster and costing us a fortune. They should all be self isolating at home and sharing the pain with everyone else. Stay well, stay safe and please try and be nice during all this upset."

The Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support scheme is another extraordinary multi-billion pound support, reflecting the brutal economic impact of a shutdown designed to keep the pandemic in check.

“You have not been forgotten” said the chancellor.

In recent days, Treasury ministers appeared to be trying to dampen down expectations, telling MPs that it was problematic to establish a fair scheme and that the employee job retention scheme would be the logistical priority. And the government wants to set up the scheme to keep employed jobs as the priority first.

So, the banks will need to be relied on to support many of these self-employed with overdrafts to tie them over till the grant goes in their bank accounts in around 10 weeks’ time.

Although lenders have made public announcements regarding individual mortgages, there is currently no relief available in the buy-to-let sector, which limits the ability of landlords to help tenants.
““The coming weeks and months are undoubtedly going to be difficult for tenants and landlords alike with a lot of uncertainty and change.
That is why we are also urging landlords to act on behalf of tenants affected to have mortgage payments paused so that this can be passed on to help.”","tenant, sal, outbreak, pledge, difficulty, covid19, landlords, affected, help, rent, scottish, mortgage, tenants","Scotland’s largest and only dedicated national landlord organisation today issued a five-point plan for its members to ensure they can help tenants affected by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.

The Scottish Association of Landlords (SAL), today urged landlords to follow 5 simple steps to help tenants who might be affected by the implications of Covid-19 in Scotland.

The actions include checking on the welfare of tenants they think might be affected, particularly older or vulnerable people for whom a landlord might be their only contact; being proactive to help tenants who expect to experience difficulty paying rent; and ensuring landlords are aware of their legal responsibilities.

SAL has also called for landlords to be able to request assistance with mortgage payments in circumstances where a tenant is experiencing difficulty, with any savings being passed on, helping to ensure that tenants do not fall into arrears.

Although lenders have made public announcements regarding individual mortgages, there is currently no relief available in the buy-to-let sector, which limits the ability of landlords to help tenants.

Landlords are urged to:

Talk with tenants who might be affected by Covid-19, particularly get in touch with those at risk such as older people or those in vulnerable groups. Be flexible with tenants and help them not to fall into rent arrears. Understand their legal responsibilities. You are not alone. SAL is here to help and is giving expert advice to our member landlords in these difficult times. Not yet a member? Then join here. Ask their mortgage provider for relief if a tenant is in difficulty due to Covid-19 and directly pass on any benefit to the tenant via a rent reduction. Seek advice and information for tenants from government, trade bodies and charities regarding issues such as benefit entitlements.

John Blackwood, Chief Executive of SAL, said: “This is some basic advice we are providing to our members about how to support tenants affected by Covid-19 over the coming period.”

“The vast majority of landlords are already very flexible in working with tenants experiencing difficulty with rents and the law rightly says that no attempt can be made to evict anyone unless they are in rent arrears by three consecutive months.”

“Although the expectation is that most of those who contract Covid-19 will recover in 7-10 days, there will undoubtedly be much wider economic impacts for many people and landlords must be understanding and alert to these. “

“The coming weeks and months are undoubtedly going to be difficult for tenants and landlords alike with a lot of uncertainty and change. That is why we are also urging landlords to act on behalf of tenants affected to have mortgage payments paused so that this can be passed on to help.”"

Scottish Ministers’ announcement of a temporary legislative change to amend the mandatory grounds for eviction for rent arrears under the Private Residential Tenancy, from three months to six months is now academic as this evening, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, it has been announced that the Housing and Property Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal that deals with eviction cases, will not be hearing cases until at least 28 May but this could be much longer.

Many UK households have suffered and continue to suffer financial losses as a result of the virus.



Under the terms of the tenancy agreement the rent is still due as normal. However, we have from the outset suggested working with your tenants to try to help them through this period if possible, particularly if they have a history of good payment in the past.

Agents should discuss any coronavirus related rent arrears with their landlord clients to get their instructions. If the landlord wishes you to, you should follow your standard debt recovery procedure.

Guidance on rent arrears and debt recovery can be found in our factsheet here, (members remember to log in to see and download documents).

The SAL position is that part of the solution to the current crisis, is that the government needs to help tenants to pay their rent. If rents are paid, there will be no need for evictions and later arrears recovery. With rents paid, business, employment and housing situations can be more secure for everyone.



Tenants should be encouraged to seek their own advice on any benefits or sick pay they may be entitled to. They can get free advice from:

New Tenant Hardship Grant fund

From day one of the pandemic SAL, as part of the Scottish Government PRS Covid-19 resilience group, lobbied for support for tenants to be able to pay their rent and later for help for them to pay off Covid-19 related rent arrears.

We are therefore pleased that the Scottish Government has now distributed a new £10 million grant fund to local authorities which is to be used to support tenants who are struggling as a direct result of the pandemic. The grant funding is available from now until 31 March 2022. It can be used to pay off arrears which arose between 23 March 2020 and 9 August 2021 and the money is paid directly to the landlord.

The grant is being administered by local authorities and landlords, letting agents or tenants can enquire about eligibility by contacting their local authority housing options or homelessness departments. See local authority contact details on our webpage here.



People affected by coronavirus who are concerned about paying their rent can claim Universal Credit (UC) from the Department for Work and Pensions which includes support for housing costs, if eligible. The UK Government has introduced some temporary changes to make this easier. The following website provides further information on applying for UC: www.gov.uk/universal-credit



If a tenant is getting Housing Benefit or UC, but still can’t afford their housing costs, they may be eligible for a Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP). Further information on DHPs and how to apply is available at: www.mygov.scot/discretionary-housing-payment



Tenants may also be able to get support through the Scottish Welfare Fund. Further information on how to apply is available on: www.mygov.scot/scottish-welfare-fund/crisis-grants

To assist tenants to find help to pay, some members are providing information to pass to tenants who are saying they think they will not be able to pay some or all of their rent. We have published templates as below for members to adapt and use, (members please log in to see and download our documents).

Additional advice for tenants

Landlords may like to consider issuing guidance to their tenants, particularly where they have properties let to multiple individuals on separate leases who may not know each other well. Guidance should cover the importance of letting their housemates and any potential visitors to the property know if they are symptomatic/self-isolating and highlighting the precautions we should all be taking to reduce the spread of the virus which can be found on the NHS website here.

Scottish Curling recognises the growing concern among all communities in Scotland in relation to the current spread of the Coronavirus. We have been in close communication with our partners in the lead up to the decision to cancel the World Men’s Curling Championship in Glasgow and the dialogue with government continues on a daily basis. Over the weekend, we received a briefing from Scottish Government that included the following:

”There will clearly be implications across all organised sport in Scotland. The impact of the advice is that large-scale events should not take place across a range of sports. Sports may also wish to consider the viability of holding grassroots and club activity, in light of the increased spread of the virus and the impact that may have on both participants, staff and volunteers. Sports may wish to carefully consider cancelling sessions specifically aimed at older adults given the increased risk posed to those individuals.”

The Government statement also advised:

”Further measures may be taken as the situation develops. The Scottish Government are continuing to liaise with all sports bodies, in the interest of the health and safety of participants, coaches, support staff and volunteers.”

We do not operate any facilities but must act responsibly for our members, volunteers and staff, in addition to our partner organisations, sponsors and the ice rinks in Scotland. We are therefore cancelling the remaining Scottish Curling competitions till the end of April.

All participants will be notified immediately and entry fees will automatically be refunded to all participants. We will continue to monitor the situation for events beyond the end of April, including the Scottish Curling Mixed Championship (22-24 May 2020).

The cancelled competitions are:

21/3/20 Funspiel (Braehead)

29/3/20 Newcomers (Braehead)

29/3/20 Virtual Club Challenge (Dundee)

10-12/4/20 Junior Mixed Doubles (Dumfries)

17/3/20 Sweeping (Dundee)

23/3/20 Stick Delivery (Dundee)

7/4/20 Child Wellbeing and Protection (Ayr) – now being run virtually/online

The following courses will proceed, by being delivered virtually (online):

24/3/20 Child Wellbeing and Protection in Sport

7/4/20 Child Wellbeing and Protection in Sport (formerly at Ayr Ice Rink)

The Annual General Meeting of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club is currently scheduled to take place in Forfar on Saturday 27 June and we will continue to monitor the viability of this going ahead on that date.

We know that individuals have changed behaviours (avoiding hand shakes and physical contact) and those with pre-existing medical conditions have been limiting their exposure by reduced social activities, including not curling. We are also aware that ice rinks have taken steps to regularly sanitise handles on stones and doors and other steps to ensure hygiene standards remain high. However curlers have been cancelling games due to the virus and some ice rinks have already closed and others are considering their circumstances, so please follow local advice and we hope to see you on the ice next season.

Scottish Curling’s business will continue to operate as normally as we can. Some meetings have been cancelled and others will be held via telephone/video conferencing facilities. Our staff will be working from home where appropriate and we will share updates via our website and social media channels as much as possible.

Further advice for the public is available through NHS Inform. The Scottish Government is also putting out the latest information and advice through social media channels, and on the Scottish Government website. People can reduce the risk of acquiring and spreading respiratory infections by practising good hygiene, such as:

avoiding direct hand contact with your eyes, nose and mouth

maintaining good hand hygiene

washing hands with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser, after coughing or sneezing, after going to the toilet, and prior to eating and drinking

avoiding direct contact with people that have a respiratory illness and not using their personal items such as their mobile phone

covering their nose and mouth with disposable tissues when coughing or sneezing and disposing of them in the nearest waste bin after use.

We do hope to see all of our members, staff and volunteers back next season, healthy and eager to start curling!"

The event had been scheduled to take place at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow from 28 March to 5 April and was being delivered through a partnership between Glasgow Life, UK Sport, EventScotland (part of VisitScotland’s Events Directorate) and Scottish Curling.

Announcing the cancellation, Billy Garrett, Director of Sport and Events at Glasgow Life said:

“When hosting major events, the safety and well-being of everyone involved in the event including athletes, officials, spectators, volunteers and staff is our absolute priority.

“Given the UK Government’s move from the ‘contain’ to the ‘delay’ phase of their coronavirus action plan and the latest advice from the Scottish Government with respect to the hosting of major sports events at this time, it is with great regret that the Local Organising Committee, in conjunction with the World Curling Federation, has agreed to cancel this event in the interest of public health.

“We are extremely disappointed for the athletes, who we know have been training hard and were looking forward to competing in their pinnacle event of the year here in Glasgow, and for the staff and volunteers who have been working tirelessly over the last year to deliver an outstanding Championship.

“We also know from the strong ticket sales for the event that its cancellation will be a huge disappointment to curling fans from home and abroad. However, we believe that in the current unprecedented situation this is the only responsible course of action to take.”

All ticket holders will receive a full refund including booking fee and customers will be contacted by email with details of the process.

“Following the recent advice from the Scottish Government it is with deep regret that we now must cancel the LGT World Men’s Curling Championship 2020.

All work must be carried out in strict accordance with government guidelines on social distancing and comply with ALL other standard health and safety requirements. https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-business-and-social-distancing-guidance/

Clubs should consider the following and risk assess appropriately, specifically if the greenkeeper is a club volunteer:

Does the greenkeeper fall into any of the high risk COVID-19 categories? If so, they should stay at home.

Can the volunteer practice safe social distancing and comply with ALL other standard health and safety requirements?

If the volunteer falls ill, what procedures are in place? For example a check in, check out system (a phone call to an agreed club official to ensure the greenkeeper is safe and well)

Is the volunteer willing and able to maintain the green?

What additional precautions can be implemented? E.g. cleaning all equipment after use, use of disposable gloves, hand washing regularly throughout, following guidance on filling up fuel etc.

We are aware that several insurance policies will not cover any bowling club affected by the Coronavirus. We would encourage clubs to contact their insurance companies as soon as possible to clarify.

What can we do to make our club premises more secure?

Unfortunately, at this time, premises can be vulnerable to crime. Please ensure your property is safe and secured and if you are securing property contents elsewhere, please check with your insurer to ensure the policy is covered. We recommend checking if your insurer covers property that is empty/unused for a period of time.

How can we still have our AGMs and other meetings?

There are a few phone (conference calls) or online (email and webinar) meeting facilities available: Zoom, Go-To-Webinar, Skype etc. Some are free, some have a cost attached.

Our National Development Officer, Daniel Baker, has produced a video guide to help clubs set up video call meetings on Zoom. To watch this, please click here.

What advice would go to clubs around members paying fees for the season ahead?

We are also encouraging all Scottish bowlers to, where possible, continue to pay their membership fees for the upcoming season to help your club manage through this unprecedented situation.

If I've already paid my club fees should I be entitled to a refund?

This would be up to individual clubs; however, we would encourage clubs to ask members to not ask for a refund and continue to support their local club throughout this time.

Competitions:

Will Stage 1 (District) and Stage 2 of the National Championships still go ahead?

Unfortunately, both stage 1 and stage 2 will not go ahead in 2020. Any clubs that have paid entry fees to the National Championships will receive a refund. This will be processed as soon as we can, we would ask clubs to be patient while we do this.

If a player won the National Championships in 2019 when will they get to play British Isles; will this be 2021?

We will await further instruction from BIBC/BIWBC on when the British Isles Championships could take place. This could potentially be later this year if that is an option or in 2021. Bowls Scotland will contact the players directly with further information when we know more.

If I won my club ties in 2019 will I play national playdown championships in 2021?

The method of selection of players for National Championships shall be left to the discretion of the member club. All players selected must be members of the club they are chosen to represent. (National Championships Rule 3.8)

What about our open tournaments where we have paid a licence fee?

Clubs will be refunded their licence fee for any open competitions that they registered with us and made payment for. This will be processed as soon as we can, we would ask clubs to be patient while we do this.

What happens if the season opens back up later in the year and competitions run in August/September?

Bowls Scotland will continue to monitor the situation and update as soon as we more information.

Will the Andrew Hamilton and Ladies National Top Ten be played?

Both competitions will not go ahead in 2020 – Ladies & Gents Associations that have affiliated and paid entry fees into these competitions will receive a refund. This will be processed as soon as we can, we would ask clubs to be patient while we do this. Non-Association entries will also receive a refund.

Will there be any Competitions this year?

Depending on further recommendations from the government there may be an opportunity for Bowls Scotland to launch an open competition later in the year if it is deemed safe to do so. Further details will be released if this becomes an option for us.

Will the BIBC/BIWBC Internationals take place this year?

All BIBC & BIWBC Championships & International Series except for the BIBC Junior Internationals in September have been cancelled. The BIBC/BIWBC Statement can be found here.

Should I still send in my BIBC/BIWBC application for Trials?

We have now stopped the application process for 2020. When a decision is made from BIBC regarding the Junior Internationals in September we will communicate this out through our website and social media channels.

Will the Linda Brennan U25 Pairs competition go ahead?

This competition has been postponed for this year. Entries to this competition have now been stopped. As this was a qualifying event for the BIWBC Junior Championships we will await further instructions from BIWBC as to when the next U25 Championship event is due to take place.

High Performance:

What is happening with World Championships?

Both indoor and outdoor World Championships have been postponed. Bowls Scotland have contacted all players and coaches due to be involved. Updates will be provided as we get them from World Bowls. The IBD World Championships due to take place in Christchurch in November 2020 have been postponed. Updates will be provided as we get them from World Bowls.

Will the Para Home Nations take place?

Bowls Scotland will review whether the Para Home Nations event due to take place at the National Centre for Bowling, Ayr, in September will go ahead. As soon as we know further information, we will share it with our players and members.

When will squad sessions be taking place?

Following on from the latest Scottish Government advice the Board of Bowls Scotland has taken the decision to cancel all Bowls Scotland events for the 2020 season.



As the National Governing Body for lawn bowls in Scotland we have a duty of care to all our members and clubs to put people’s health first. Bowls is an inclusive sport accessible to people of all ages, genders and abilities. We have been closely monitoring the ongoing situation regarding COVID-19 and have taken on board advice from the Scottish Government. Following significant deliberation, the Board has taken this decision in the interest of protecting our members, particularly those in the most vulnerable groups.



At an emergency Bowls Scotland Board meeting on Wednesday 18th March 2020 it was decided to cancel the following events:



• Bowls Scotland National Championships (Stage One & Stage Two)

• Ladies National Top 10

• Linda Brennan Ladies U25 Pairs

• Andrew Hamilton Trophy



Moving forward we will not be accepting any applications from clubs for our Try Bowls programme pending further government guidance. We will also not be running any Introduction, Level 1 or Level 2 Bowls Coaching Courses until further notice.



We fully understand that many clubs may suffer financial or operational difficulties due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and we have therefore put in place a series of support packages as set out below.



Club Support:-

• Capitation fees, National Competition entry fees and Tournament Licences fees for the 2020 season will be returned to all clubs and Associations that have already paid.

• On Thursday 19th March, we will be releasing a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s) document on our website for all our clubs and members.

• We will also be setting up a Bowls Scotland Helpline that will be available for any officials of member clubs to phone and receive assistance with any queries or concerns.

• Development Team will continue to host Online Webinars for anyone looking for additional Safeguarding and club support.

• Bowls Scotland is also looking at setting up a new Club Support Fund to assist clubs through this difficult period. More information to follow shortly.



The Board are currently considering options for competitive bowls later in the 2020 season if the current circumstances change in sufficient time.



Bowls Scotland recommend that our member clubs consider the health and welfare of every player, coach and volunteer and carefully follow Government advice relating to the delivery of any activities during this period of uncertainty. We hope that everyone will follow this strong recommendation. Bowls Scotland will notify all clubs when there are any changes to the Scottish Government’s advice.

We are also encouraging all Scottish bowlers to, where possible, continue to pay their membership fees for the upcoming season to help your club manage through this unprecedented situation. We will also continue to work closely with the Scottish Government to identify any new funding and financial support/relief which will hopefully be made accessible to all sports clubs in Scotland.



Finally, please follow all the relevant advice on how to avoid catching or spreading the virus. We would encourage you all to look after your own health and the health of your members. Bowls Scotland recognises that these are uncertain and unprecedented times for the bowling community and will remain in contact with clubs at this difficult time.



Bowls Scotland Chair, Sue Beatt, said: “Bowls Scotland, our clubs, members and the whole sport are unfortunately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We have had to take these difficult decisions to cancel all our key events for the year. The welfare of all our members is a top priority to us as an organisation and we have carefully considered all options to do what’s best for the bowling community in Scotland.



“The Board would like to thank our CEO and all the staff for their hard work over the last couple of weeks. They have worked tirelessly, long hours and have reacted to an ever-changing situation. The Bowls Scotland Board and key staff will continue to hold weekly meetings to review and co-ordinate the organisations response to this ongoing and fluid situation.”



The National Centre for Bowling at Northfield in Ayr has now closed; however the Bowls Scotland Office remains open with all staff available by working remotely to support your club. If you have any urgent requests please send them via email to info@bowlsscotland.com or phone the office in the usual manner on 01292 294623.

Active Scotland has confirmed that the current advice and guidance is still very relevant, whereby people can reduce the risk of acquiring and spreading respiratory infections by practising good hygiene, such as:

• Avoiding direct hand contact with your eyes, nose and mouth;

• Maintaining good hand hygiene;

• Washing hands with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser, after coughing or sneezing, after going to the toilet, and prior to eating and drinking;

• Avoiding direct contact with people that have a respiratory illness and not using their personal items such as their mobile phone;

• Covering their nose and mouth with disposable tissues when coughing or sneezing and disposing of them in the nearest waste bin after use;

Anyone with flu-symptoms should avoid the risk of spreading their infection, whatever that infection may be, by staying at home and recovering.



Further Considerations

Boxing Scotland will continue to review its planned future activities – particularly where delivery is on a ‘face-to-face’ basis – until further clarity is provided by the Scottish Government and will be communicating further with those affected.

Following consultation with our various partners and our Senior Management team, it is with great regret that we must inform everyone involved in the Elite and Youth preliminaries scheduled to take place on Saturday 14 March and Sunday 15 March 2020 will now not be happening as planned due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

As a Governing Body of Sport, we have been keeping a very close eye on developments and are aware of the ever increasing amount of signifcant sporting events being cancelled. Furthermore, having been in touch with Ravenscraig Regional Sports Centre, it was confirmed by centre management that there will still be a number of events taking place within the facility over the weekend. This means we cannot guarantee that the Preliminaries will be a gathering of less than 500 people as per recently published government guidance. We appreciate this will cause significant inconvenience for those involved in the event but we must minimise the risk of infection as much as we possibly can. We also have a responsibility for the health and welfare of our members, family members and spectators.

As an alternative, the preliminaries will now be contested on the weekend of 21 & 22 March 2020 in the Boxing Scotland High Performance Centre in Bridgeton Glasgow. Depending on further guidance expected on Monday, there is a very high liklihood that both days of boxing will take place behind closed doors with only Boxers, Coaches and Officials present. We have the means to screen all the action live via an internet stream.

We will ensure adequate sanitary provisions are in place for everyone and it is recommended that all boxers still wishing to compete use their own bandages, head guards and gloves (head guards and gloves must be AIBA licensed equipment).

We shall continue to monitor the situation very closely and communicate any further information relating to the championships as soon as we possibly can. We can only apologise for the disruption to our 2020 Championships but feel it is the correct and only decision to take at this juncture.

We appreciate that some clubs may wish to continue to operate.

Those most at risk strongly advised to reduce unnecessary contact.

To slow the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus) the general public are being asked to stay at home as much as possible and avoid unnecessary social contact.

People over 70 and those who have high risk and underlying health conditions are being strongly advised to stay at home as much as possible and significantly reduce unnecessary social contact.

The advice is that people should:

minimise social contact by avoiding crowded areas and large gatherings, including religious congregations and smaller gatherings such as restaurants, pubs, bars, clubs, cinemas and gyms

avoid using public transport as much as possible

work from home when possible

follow the latest health and travel advice, and follow basic hygiene precautions, such as washing hands frequently, not touching their face and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing

People showing symptoms suggestive of coronavirus should stay at home for seven days and only contact NHS 111 or their local GP if their symptoms worsen during that period.

Members of a household where someone has suspected symptoms should stay at home for 14 days."

Road race season revised

Athletics in Scotland can show real ‘resilience’ to thrive and grow in a difficult landscape for the sport globally.

That’s the message from chief executive Mark Munro in his column in PB magazine, being issued to 14,000 scottishathletics members this week.

Munro wrote the column shortly before the coronavirus situation escalated and, at that time, was reacting to doping headlines around the screening of Panorama and leadership issues at UK Athletics.

If anything, and in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, the key message holds even more weight now – that the best option for the sport in Scotland is to stick together to ride out storm clouds.

‘I write this on the back of a massive high of pure Scottish camaraderie at the Lindsays Scottish XC at Falkirk and the SPAR British Indoor Championships in Glasgow and following a number of weeks of Scottish record breaking successes on the international circuit, not least a young Jemma Reekie,’ writes Mark in PB magazine.

‘However, I’ve woken up this morning with the harsh reality of widespread allegations of unethical ‘cheating’ by the UK’s most successful athlete of all time and question marks about the culture set by a few individuals within our UK body.

‘It is disheartening when we work so hard to develop our wonderful sport in this country from the grassroots right through to elite athletes and coaches.

‘True spirit of our sport’ – Lindsays National XC at Falkirk (photo by Bobby Gavin)

‘Whilst we are not perfect and there are lots of areas to improve on, the sport in Scotland is well connected, both strategically through the national strategy (Building a Culture of Success) and in practice – on the ground where it really matters.

‘I think all the athletes, coaches, volunteers, supporters and spectators at the recent Lindsays National XC at Callendar Park showed the true spirit of the sport and demonstrated resilience on a terrible day in tough, tough conditions.

The word resilience is the key and athletics in Scotland must be resilient whilst these challenges go on around us at UK and global level.

‘We must believe in what we are trying to achieve in Scotland and continue to drive forward setting the (moral) bar high and sticking to our principles.

‘Within the wider UK context, I’m sure that from helplessness will come opportunity.

‘We will work with sportscotland, UK Sport, UK Athletics and the other Home Countries to support the reconfiguration of the sport across the UK and imminently, both our Chair, Ian Beattie, and myself will be contributing to the UK Sport‘s review of UK Athletics to help create a plan to move the sport move forward.

BBC Scotland coverage

Stephen Maguire believes it will be ‘incredibly difficult’ for the Olympics to go ahead as planned.

Japan are still planning a ‘complete’ Games, with fans in attendance, despite the coronavirus pandemic forcing the postponement of sporting events worldwide.

The International Olympic Committee will have the final say on whether to reschedule.

But Stephen, Director of Performance and Coaching with scottishathletics, and Head of Relays, Sprints and Hurdles for the British Athletics international teams, admits there are huge concerns.

‘They need to make a decision pretty soon,’ Stephen told BBC Scotland.

‘They will absolutely have the athletes’ interests at heart, but there’s major considerations around when it’s going to happen and if it’s going to happen.

‘Looking at things at the moment, you’d say this is going to be incredibly difficult to start in July.

Too early to make a decision – Lord Coe

The Tokyo stadium which is scheduled to host the Olympic track and field in late July

Diamond League meetings postponed

‘The first three Diamond Leagues are cancelled, the athletes’ ability to be able to train and compete is in darkness. It’s the not knowing; the earlier we can be told the better.

‘But I do understand how difficult it is because we ourselves are having to work really hard on domestic and local fixture rescheduling.

Stephen also feels uncertainty over whether the showpiece will take place could have detrimental effect on mental health for athletes and coaches.

‘Anything that is an interference becomes a distraction,’ he said.

‘For some athletes that raises things a real tense level of intensity, a level where they don’t know, so they find it difficult to cope with.

‘It is an issue, from the psychology end of things we are speaking to a lot of people about. The early part of the season has now been cancelled and that throws everything in doubt.

‘How do we get competitions, to run the times we need, throw the distance we need or jump the height required? That’s the bit that’s compromising them at the moment.’

‘Incredibly difficult to stage Olympics in July’ – Stephen Maguire

Zoey Clark has admitted top Scottish athletes are struggling to ‘get their heads around’ the uncertainty over the Olympics.

Tokyo 2020 organisers, the International Olympic Committee and World Athletics insisted the event will start as planned in late July – despite exerted pressure from many areas of the sport that this is unrealistic.

Athletes for their part have to try and maintain their focus despite huge doubts about the possibility of landing qualifying standards or indeed a British Trials event taking place.

‘It’s mad because things have changed so quickly,’ London 2017 relay silver medallist Zoey told the Herald.

‘As recently as last week, we thought our camp in America would still go ahead and then a couple of days later, it was all cancelled. Everything happened really quickly.

‘It’s so hard to get your head around everything and what’s so dif?cult is that we still don’t know what’s going to happen.

‘With how things are, you can’t see the Olympics going on as normal but this week, the organisers said things were going ahead.

‘You can’t get closure because you still have to prepare as if the Olympics are on and you have to stay motivated but then, in the back of your mind, you’re wondering if the Olympics will happen.

British Athletics chief calls for Olympics clarity

Zoey and Eilidh Doyle won 4x400m silver at London 2017

‘I desperately want the Olympics to take place this year because we work in four year cycles and literally the past four years have been working towards this.

‘It’s so hard to get your head around though because if the Olympics do go ahead as scheduled no one would have any competitions before it, so how do people qualify?’

Nonetheless, training goes on.

‘I’m really fortunate that I have a gym in my garage so it means I can still lift weights,’ added Zoey.

‘And being a runner, I’m more fortunate than athletes in other sports because we can ?nd a ?eld and run there. It’s not ideal, but it’s manageable.’

BBC News: Olympics and Paralympics put back to 2021

Stephen Maguire has welcomed the decision to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics to 2021.

Our Director of Performance and Coaching is relieved about the delay after starting to fear for the physical and mental welfare of athletes (and their coaches).

Due to the coronavirus crisis, the event will now take place ‘no later than summer 2021’. It had been due to start on July 24.

‘I proposed to postpone for a year and IOC president Thomas Bach responded with 100% agreement,’ Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said. The event will still be called Tokyo 2020 despite taking place in 2021.

Stephen had actually addressed a scottishathletics Board meeting by conference call on Monday night when he explained real fears after recent conversations with our elite athletes and potential Olympians and Paralympians.

‘It is sad for the sport when something like this happens and the Olympics and Paralympics are postponed to 2021,’ said Stephen, who also has a role with British Athletics in Sprints, Hurdles and Relays.

‘But I am very pleased to hear it to be honest.

‘I’ve been saying consistently for the past couple of weeks that it would have been incredibly difficult to stage them this year and indeed the very idea was becoming impossible as each day passed.

‘To push back a little later into 2020 also didn’t seem like the right option.

‘Olympics uncertainty hard to deal with’ -Zoey Clark (prior to the decision)

2021 ✨

I am going to use this extra year to get faster, stronger and fitter for the Olympics. 💪🏼

I will use the hunger and excitement to push myself and make every minute count. 💥

Stay safe, be sensible and do what we are told. This will come to a end💖💪🏼 pic.twitter.com/b0XUDnYDSQ — JemmaReekie (@JemmaReekie) March 24, 2020

‘In Britain, we’re pretty much in full lock-down and while athletes can exercise once a day, subject to Government guidelines, venues all across the country are shut.

‘They don’t have access to face to face coaching, they can’t see a physio and they cannot get treatment.

‘People may not be aware, but our elite Scottish athletes and Paralympians would have been in real limbo if they’d been injured at this time.

‘There would really be nowhere for them to go with that other than the NHS and, of course, they have far more significant priorities to deal with and rightly so.

‘I’ve been talking to athletes and coaches constantly in recent weeks and one of the phrases was to try and keep ‘ticking over’.

‘But when actually that becomes difficult, there is no prospect of competition to achieve standards and issues over a qualifying trials then there were all sorts of issues regardless of if Japan was somehow OK to travel to at some later date.

‘And at last we have some certainty. The lack of clarity was a definite danger in mental health terms – frustration building up at not being able to train in the right way or the right environment, frustration at a lack of competition, a fear of not being suddenly ready when asked to be.

‘So all in all I am very relieved with this outcome from what is a difficult time for so many people.’

Instead of competing at the Paralympics this year, I’ll be contending with the panic buyers for toilet roll! In all seriousness, it was the best decision made with everyone’s best intentions at heart.

Events Section pages – dates for National Championships

The coronavirus crisis has hit Scottish and global sport in dramatic fashion over the past week – with big decisions required on projected events and our ‘traditional’ calendar.

Road races have felt the impact significantly but we are now in a position to present proposals for an altered track and field season in Scotland.

Our Track and Field Commission and scottishathletics staff met last week and have already started the process of rescheduling dates and working with venues and event organisers.

At this stage, we must stress that even the newly proposed track and field season could be subject to change (depending on Government guidelines on events; the availability of venues and/or the British Athletics Champs and Olympic Trials – if indeed Japan goes ahead in 2020).

A number of events have had to be cancelled and will not return later in 2020.

We’re sorry about that but obviously the Track and Field Commission, led by Leslie Roy, and scottishathletics, led by Alasdhair Love, are now working with a short time-frame and are seeking to prioritise National Championship events.

The rationale behind that is to try and give everyone an end-of-season target and a chance for the sport to meet together and coach, compete and officiate.

Entries for the revised track and field season will not open until the start of July (bearing in mind that many venues are closed indefinitely for now).

On some of the weekends where we have major events planned, we are looking to establish if we can use the venues on Fridays to slot in additional, event-specific meets. This would help create a few additional competition opportunities.

As it stands, the 4J Studios Senior and U17 Champs will now be at Grangemouth on September 5/6. The 4J Studios Age Groups will be the following weekend of September 12/13 – with the venue to be confirmed.

Here’s a new list of cancelled and rescheduled events:

National 10,000m Championships : POSTPONED – Friday 17 April, Glasgow, new date to be advised by Glasgow Athletics Association

All Age Group District Championships: May 29-31 (U13/U15/U17) – CANCELLED and will not be rescheduled in 2020

National Outdoor Open (U20/Senior): May 30/31 – CANCELLED and will not be rescheduled in 2020

National 3000m Championships (U17/U20): POSTPONED – Friday 8 May, Crown Point, Glasgow, new date to be advised by GAA

National 5000m Champs: POSTPONED – Saturday 4 July, Cumbernauld (new date TBC)

SUPERteams National Final:RESCHEDULED – Saturday 8 August, Grangemouth

National Relay Championships: RESCHEDULED – Sunday 9 August, Grangemouth

National Masters Championships: RESCHEDULED – Saturday 22 August, Aberdeen

(*We are aware this is a potential clash with British Masters Champs but unfortunately with only so many slots available for many events this is unavoidable).

National Combined Events Championships: RESCHEDULED – Saturday 22/Sunday 23 August, Aberdeen

National Masters 10,000m Championships: Saturday 29 August, Ravenscraig Stadium, Greenock

4J Studios National Senior/U17 Championships: RESCHEDULED – Saturday 5/Sunday 6 September, Grangemouth

4J Studios National U13/U15/U20 Championships: RESCHEDULED – Saturday 12/Sunday 13 September, Venue TBC

The Commission also agreed the following actions for what will be a potentially congested calendar in late Summer:

*Scottish league matches will not be rescheduled if cancelled and leagues should operate a decreasing fixture programme if and when fixtures are cancelled.

*Event Specific series competition events – may not be rescheduled unless a specific requirement (eg qualification for major junior/senior championship).

If required we will utilise the Friday evenings of our bookings and open provide competition opportunities of an event specific nature – Speed, Throws, Jumps, Endurance.

*Open Graded Meets or Club Meets – can potentially be rescheduled if midweek and not clashing with another local event already licensed in calendar.

We fully appreciate that these events often generate much-needed income for clubs and we want to support as much as possible.

Scottish Schools athletics events have been cancelled for 2020 and will not be rescheduled.

The Scottish Schools Athletics Association made the decision in view of school closures and in line with advice from the Scottish Government and ourselves.

Grangemouth had been due to stage the Secondary Schools Track and Field Champs on June 12/13 but this will not happen.

Here is the statement from the SSAA:

‘In the light of the current situation and the news that Scottish schools are closed and will remain so for the foreseeable future, the SSAA have taken the decision to cancel the outdoor Track and Field events in June.

‘This includes the Primary and Secondary Relays, Pentathlon Championships and the Secondary Track and Field Championships.

‘It is not a decision that we have wished to take, but feel it is the correct one in the present climate.’

Events had been due to take place in Helensburgh, Dumbarton and Glasgow Green.

Babcock 10k series organisers said: ‘A decision has been taken to postpone this year’s Babcock 10k Series from May until new dates which are expected to be in September once the impact of the Coronavirus is hoped to have subsided.

‘This decision was taken based upon advice from the Scottish Government and in turn from scottishathletics.

‘It also takes into account the fact that local authorities have cancelled all bookings for their facilities for the foreseeable future and the need to protect the resources of medical service providers and the emergency services for greater priorities.

‘All entries will be carried forward to the new dates and anyone unable to take part as a result of the change in dates can request a refund or a rollover to next year’s series.’

The wellbeing, health and safety of all our members, players, staff, workforce, volunteers and fans is a priority for Netball Scotland. In light of recent developments surrounding COVID-19 we have been closely monitoring the situation to ensure that we are responding quickly and effectively, and in line with the latest Government guidelines and recommendations.

Following today’s announcement from the First Minister of Scotland advising that we are moving as a nation from a ‘containment’ to ‘delay’ phase, and the guidelines that the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland and Scottish Government have recommended, we will be taking the following measures to support the actions being undertaken to try to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus in Scotland:

All upcoming Netball Scotland education courses, competitions and events will go ahead as planned until we are advised otherwise.

The only exception to this will be our Walking Netball Programme. In line with the Government guidelines around the protection of our “elderly population, those with existing underlying health problems and our most vulnerable members of society” we will work closely with our Partners and Facilities to take appropriate and effective measures where necessary.

The guidelines around mass gatherings mean that next week’s scheduled Vitality Netball Superleague home fixture against Team Bath will still go ahead as planned but with restricted ticket sales, pre-match activity and athlete engagement.

We will continue to encourage all fans, members, players, volunteers and workforce to follow the recommended guidelines around personal hygiene and advise anyone with a cough, fever or flu like symptoms to stay at home. We also advise the frail, elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions to stay at home to minimise unnecessary contact with others.

Netball Scotland staff will, where possible, operate digitally to minimise disruption, continue member and partner engagement and reduce unnecessary contact.

This is a unique and evolving situation for the UK which we will continue to monitor closely, providing regular updates and communications where possible. We want to assure all of our members that we are taking all of the necessary measures to ensure that you can continue to enjoy our sport up and down the country.

Updates on public health advice for COVID-19 can be found on the NHS Inform website, and a free helpline has been set up for those who do not have symptoms but are looking for general health advice: 0800 028 2816."

This letter has appeared on the Highland Council e-planning pages and there is other documentation concerning the controversial application here on the relevant file on the Council website.





Please consider everything outlined here folks. Are we on the cusp of a new ""Community Empowerment"" dawn or does this application just mean more (actually lots more) of the same?





""For the attention of Keith Gibson, Planning Officer

Highland Council

PLANNING APPLICATION 20/00338/FUL: Nairn Town Centre/62 King St





I object to the proposal set out in application 20/00338/FUL

Before setting out the detailed and specific reasons, I wish to make three general observations.





• Regeneration : This area is the critical central part of the town. It defines the character and identity of Nairn, for both residents and visitors. A revived town centre has to fulfil a number of functions as well as complying with official guidance and responding to public expectations. Nairn town centre requires (and has) an overall, integrated development strategy which meets all those objectives. We have only one chance to get it right. The present application neither delivers nor contributes to that outcome.





• The CAB . The planning application by Highland Council is to construct a single building. It is not a popularity poll on the activities or worthiness of the Citizens’ Advice Bureau, which has been identified as potential occupant of the ground floor. I recognise, like most of the community, that the CAB does useful social work. That is not however a justification for it to be located in this particular proposed site. Admiration of CAB activity is not the same as support for the proposed new building. Whether or not the CAB does good work is not a consideration relevant to the planning decision;



• Housing : There is general acknowledgement that some more housing should be provided in Nairn. But it does not follow that constructing a new block of flats in this particular location is the best, best-value, or most appropriate response. Other options exist and should be fully

and carefully examined.





Objection 1. The application does not comply with, or meet the overall objectives of, the agreed Nairn Community Town Centre Plan (NCTCP); nor is it consistent with the guidance in SPP, PAN 82, or the policies for the site set out in the Inner Moray Firth Local Development Plan.





The NCTCP has a clear overarching policy which is echoed in NA7 of the IMFLDP: “The development plan highlights a clear objective to strengthen Nairn’s historic town centre with a specific focus on promoting uses that add to commercial vitality and viability, improve the physical appearance of the town centre and increase pedestrian links and footfall to the High Street. It confirms that the Council will not support development that is likely to have an adverse effect on the town centre’s vitality and viability.”





PAN 82 stipulates that: “In carrying out that assessment [of a planning application] the authority must identify all aspects of the development plan which are relevant to the proposed development, interpret them carefully taking account of the wider aims and objectives of the plan as well as the detailed wording of stated policies. ”





SPP para 28 makes clear that





""..... the aim is to achieve the right development in the right place. It is not to allow development at any cost.""





SPP para 29 establishes a firm principle:

... making efficient use of existing capacities of land, buildings and infrastructure including supporting Town Centre and regeneration policies ... protecting, enhancing, and promoting access to cultural heritage including the historic built environment"".





The IMFLDP is equally specific about the priority objectives relevant to Nairn town centre:





""Para 2.8: Promoting and protecting city and town centres. One of the main elements of the strategy...is to focus attention on the areas of towns and local centres to bolster their role as well connected meeting places and as hubs for local facilities ...





“Para 4.34: ""Develop the role of Nairn as a tourism and employment centre...”





• The new building will do nothing to add to the commercial vitality of the area, nor will it increase footfall into and through the town centre and to the High Street shops and services;





• Nor will it provide the improved social and amenity space or facilities which are identified as the wider aims of the NCTCP;





• The application offers neither a ‘well connected meeting place and hub’, nor are the functions of the building in any way related to attracting tourism or creating employment;





• A housing and office block does not offer any incentive to local residents – or passing tourists – to visit, linger, or spend time in the vicinity. It therefore fails to meet the key objective of promoting the town centre’s vitality and viability;





• The 1 or 2 bedroom flats will suit working people, whether single, couples or with those very young families: adults are likely to be away at work, children either pre-school or away at school. This will generate no more footfall or communal activity, during daytime or evenings, than occurs around the existing bus station apartment block and Royal Walk flats;





• Moreover, the planning requirement for dedicated parking provision, bin storage and access etc for a larger new building will take away space currently available and used by all the town’s residents and many visitors; • The CAB is an important support for those in the community that need help. It is essentially a private, confidential advice service. Its clientele are almost entirely from within the town’s population and – by definition – mostly those with financial and personal needs and difficulties. A substantial proportion of its clients are unlikely to regard their attendance at the CAB as a part of a wider engagement with the other services and businesses of the town centre. In that respect its location on this site is counter-intuitive;





• Relocating the CAB to the building will actually decrease the footfall to the High Street, and will leave another premises on the High Street/Cawdor Road vacant and unoccupied.





All these considerations mean that the application fails to comply with the two key requirements of the NCTCP and PAN 82 and the wider objectives of the IMFLDP. The Council (as planning authority) should therefore not be submitting or supporting the application.





Objection 2. The proposed building would pre-empt, or complicate, the delivery of other elements of the town centre regeneration plan, and does not enable or deliver on key requirements for the revival of the town centre and High Street.





The NCTCP outlined very precisely the requirements. It envisaged:





“Theme 1 .

...a civic hub in the town centre ...”





“Theme 2

... better use of area between King Street and the High Street....streets and open space could be made more attractive for walking, cycling, sitting and other social activity...”





and in particular:





“Proposal 6. Establish a new Town Square

Nairn currently lacks a large, attractive outdoor space that can accommodate community activity in the town centre... A town square’s vitality relies on it being well linked to popular walking routes, well-overlooked and surrounded by active ground floor uses...An appropriate location could be identified through the development of a masterplan for the area between the High Street and King Street, which should also set out proposals for buildings, land use, parking and movement, including improvements to east-west walking and cycling links.”





“ Proposal 8. Reconfigure car-parking to achieve more efficient use of space

Car parks in this area need to be safer and more attractive with good pedestrian access, attractive landscaping, and improved surfacing, lighting and wayfinding. Consideration could also be given to coach parking... Making car parking space more attractive was identified as a priority ..... Consultation feedback considered it to be essential to the vitality of the town centre, capable of setting parameters for other projects to follow. The layout should include dedicated parking for tourist buses.”





• The current application offers none of these these possibilities. It does not accord with the existing (master)plan, and would render more difficult the subsequent provision of a coherent and integrated multi-functional public space;





• It proposes a single rectangular block which does not, and could not, serve as a civic hub;





• It does not incorporate any open, public social or recreational space that might fulfil the function of a town square;





• Local town residents and visitors will have neither incentive nor opportunity to stroll, relax and take in the sights of that vicinity as they come and go with their shopping or their kids. • The application includes only statutory parking for its housing residents (achieved by demolishing a historic building) and precludes, or prevents, a more ambitious reconfiguration of the parking space to incorporate space and amenities for tourist, visitor and coach parking.





For these reasons consent for the application as proposed should be refused.





Objection 3. The design of the building does not acknowledge, complement or link to the important adjacent historic town centre buildings and does not enhance the appeal of the town centre as a destination.





There are three important, traditional stone buildings on the site, all owned by the Council. Two (Courthouse and Italianate School) are listed buildings. The third has been badly neglected. Each has significant history. Individually and together, they represent the character and heritage of this core part of the town.





• The application proposes a bulky rectangular building devoid of character and without distinctive features, local identity or architectural merit. The town has several of those already. None enhances the attractiveness of the town centre;





• A 12-unit housing block surrounded by car parking and bin storage is no-one’s idea of an ""enhanced streetscape"". Visitors will not be queuing up to take photos of a new town-centre view centering on a housing block and a patched-up (standalone?) old public toilet!





• The current proposal envisages the demolition of one historic building (the former Police Station/Old Social Work Building), and makes no reference to, or connection with, the others. The NCTCP explicitly proposes such a connection and the reconfiguration of functions between them;





• The destruction of the former Police Station/OSWB to be replaced by a new housing block with parking and bin storage is directly contrary to the spirit, objectives and wider aims of the NCTCP, and undermines the concept of a civic hub focused on, but extending from, the Courthouse into and across this area as set out in the NCTCP:





“Theme 1

.... a civic hub in the town centre providing a range of community and visitor services, for example, the library, citizens’ advice, tourist information, museum or other public services. Nairn Court House may have potential to accommodate some new services particularly if extended to the rear to create a new frontage to the space between King Street and the High Street....”





This application would preclude, or pre-empt, the delivery of the NCTCP proposals; and it would constrain other options (already being discussed) for the relocation and redeployment of other civic services and administrative functions in the various town centre buildings. It should therefore be refused.





Objection 4. The proposed demolition of the former Police Station/Old Social Work Building (which appears to be a prerequisite or integral part of the proposal) is unjustified, unacceptable and inconsistent with the NCTCP.





The NCTCP is quite categoric:





“Proposal 9. Bring the Council’s former social work building back into use.

This former office building is vacant and its prominent site should be brought back to productive use, ideally serving a community/cultural purpose......Restoring these buildings to active use was identified as a priority... Feedback highlighted their value as part of the traditional fabric of the town. There was keen interest in establishing an appropriate new use, with preference for community use/ownership or public use, e.g. tourist information. There was little support for demolition, despite concerns over the property’s neglected appearance and setting.”



• The dilapidated state of the building is entirely due to neglect and the owner’s (Highland Council) failure to maintain and protect it. It would set a very unfortunate precedent if it were to be accepted that in order to justify demolition or redevelopment the Council could simply let sound older buildings decline through lack of care and maintenance;





• The proposal to demolish the OSWB – in order to create parking spaces for the new block – is disguised within the application. It has apparently been the subject of a separate, unpublicised warrant which, despite the provisions of the NCTCP, had not been subject to consultation. This is unacceptable. The grant of the warrant ahead of consideration of the planning application implies bias and pre-judgement of consent and thus raises questions about the integrity of the decision-making process;





• The application dated 26 Sept 2018 by the CAB under asset transfer legislation is for the renovation of the building(s) at 60-62 King Street, not for demolition. There is no publicly available record of the consideration and approval of this application. This would suggest that the proposal to demolish is non-compliant with the terms of that application;





• It has been claimed that restoration of the OSWB is “uneconomic”. This is no more than an assertion – made by the applicant, who has a vested interest in its removal as part of this planning application;





• No independent survey evidence has been provided to support the assertion. No valuation of the site and building is currently available. No costed studies have been made available on alternative options for the re-use of the building. The case for its demolition has not been conclusively made;





• Demolition implies that the building has negligible or no value. This is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the Council has previously sought bids of – reportedly – around £70,000 for the building from local community groups seeking to bring the building back into use. This previous approach also stands in stark contrast to (and raises questions about) the arrangements under which it appears the site of 60-62 King Street was to have been sold off to the CAB for £1.





Objection 5. The prospective occupancy of the ground floor by the CAB has not been supported by agreed public policy or a published business case, and raises questions about the basis for its occupancy and the viability and longer-term utilisation of the building.





It is debatable whether the identity of the occupant of the office-space in the proposed new building is a material planning consideration. The plans indicate that the ground floor would be purpose- designed, and that the CAB will be the occupant. This is being used by the applicant as a way of appealing for support for the proposed new building.





• There is no information in the application’s design statement or supporting information which sets out the business case for the occupancy arrangements proposed;





• The CAB is an independent organisation (like many other comparable third-sector bodies) and part of a national network. It is responsible for its own financial management and for its own office arrangements. It is not a Highland Council department or subsidiary. The application sets out no reasoning or explanation as to why the Council should be constructing and providing dedicated and purpose-designed office premises for this particular organisation when it does not do the same for other comparable and possibly equally-deserving groups which deliver a social or community service;





• This also leaves unexplained the relationship between the applicant (Highland Council) and the CAB, which is a grant-funded organisation, neither a part of the Highland Council nor a private or commercial enterprise. The proposed site and building appears not to be that which the CAB sought (and may have been granted) the right to purchase. Will the CAB be tenant? Freeholder? Shared owner? The terms applying to its occupancy, and the duration of any lease or contract, are matters of legitimate public interest as well as being relevant to the status of the planning application;





• This matters, and it is material to the application, precisely because the application indicates the construction of dedicated, purpose-built premises. So the configuration of the premises is a matter for assessment as part of the planning appraisal. There are clear implications if for whatever reason, now or in the future, the CAB became unwilling, or was unable, to take up or remain in occupancy of the offices in the proposed building;

• The question thus arises of what the effect of the proposed configuration might be on the longer-term prospects for the viability and utilisation of the building, and the impact on the surrounding town centre site. Were the ground floor offices ever to fall vacant (and prove unlettable for other purposes, or be occupied by a different kind of tenant) the consequences for the town centre vicinity could be serious.





Objection 6. The application process, provision of information, and level and timing of local engagement, on a proposal where the Council is both applicant and planning authority and so at risk of conflict of interest, have failed to meet the criteria laid down in official guidance.





Local engagement in local planning is now a cardinal principle of the 2015 Community Empowerment Act and the 2019 Planning Act. In addition, PAN 82 sets out very stringent guidance in situations, such as this, where the Council is the landowner, the developer, the applicant, and the planning authority. In such circumstances there is a clear and high risk of conflict of interest.



• In this instance, the handling of the application has raised serious concerns about the integrity of the process and the good faith of those involved. Despite the adoption of the NCTCP as supplementary guidance, and the high level of local concern about the future of the town centre, the application has been prepared in private meetings, and presented fully- formed as a fait accompli (initially in a press report) with no prior public consultation and no local engagement other than – at a much later stage – in the statutory period following formal submission of the application;



• The separate and unannounced submission and approval of the demolition warrant, ahead of the planning application and discovered only by chance, adds to the impression of secrecy and bad faith, irrespective of whether the minimal formal requirements for notifying and processing of such warrants were observed.



• Given the multiple roles and direct interest of the Council in respect of this application, and in the light of para 17 of PAN 82, a decision by officials under delegated powers would be inappropriate: the application should be considered by a planning committee.





Conclusion





It has been claimed – by the applicant – that the current application ""... complies with..... and is sympathetic to...."" the NCTCP and many of the proposals within it. That claim is nonsense, and a matter of opinion. It cannot be accepted as fact. The seven specific objections itemised in detail above demonstrate that the proposal is in many key respects inconsistent with the NCTCP, and actually renders delivery of the other elements of the overall plan more difficult if not impossible.





I do not oppose the (re)development of this town centre site. My objection is to this building, for this limited purpose, in this particular part of the site. It is the wrong building, in the wrong place. It is a piecemeal, short-term initiative. It appears to have been proposed for only two narrow motives: to meet housing targets and secure a modest grant associated with relocation of the CAB.





This application prejudices the prospects for the achievement of a genuinely vital, diverse, multifunctional town centre with a range of features and facilities which might offer a focal point and destination for residents and visitors alike. This application is a wholly inadequate response – by the principal landowner and the planning authority – to the vision set out in the NCTCP.





Some of those who have already commented in their consultation-responses have identified other additional elements which ought to be incorporated in a project-design and planning proposal, and which might make it more acceptable. One of the fundamental elements of an approach to the redevelopment of such a key town centre site should always be (and usually is) that it should include 'planning gain'. Put simply, the opportunity to develop - whether offices, residential units or other business-type functions - provides a mechanism for seeking from those who develop, benefit or profit, an appropriate contribution to, or the incorporation of, spaces, facilities and amenities which are of public or community good.





At present there seems to be no thinking or planning – in this single stand-alone building proposal – for any associated or additional works which deliver that wider benefit. Consent to redevelop such an important public and community space in such a key location should only be given if it also delivers a significantly greater contribution to the rest of the vision for a revived town square and welcoming, remodelled public spaces. At the moment this building only delivers for the Council (social housing targets) and CAB (new office). In the present application there is absolutely no ""dividend"" in terms of improvements to the public realm, reconfigured structures, or other changes that will serve the wider public good and make the town centre more attractive, accessible and fit for the future.

Nairn, and this town centre site, deserves better. If development is to proceed, it requires a much more comprehensive design than the present single building. It has to be consistent with the NCTCP. It has to be integrated more sensibly with the existing and adjacent buildings. It has to be accompanied by appropriate landscaping rather than just bin storage and parking spaces. It has to contribute to, not ignore or detract from, the objectives in that agreed plan.





This application should be refused. The proposers should go back to the drawing board. The town centre needs something much better.

Welcome to Isle of Lismore, or Lios Mòr - meaning the 'Great Garden' in Gaelic

Lismore is a 10 mile long Inner Hebridean island near Oban, situated at the very South end of the Great Glen. Because of its location, it has played an important part in the prehistory and history of the West Highlands and Islands and has an ancient and unbroken tradition of Gaelic Culture with a remarkable variety of historical monuments.

Today, as well as this rich heritage, it is prized for its beauty, tranquillity, and fertility with much to offer visitors whether on a day trip or for longer. There are great places to walk, cycle, kayak, sail and picnic with views on the higher ground of the encircling mainland mountains often snowcapped in Winter, and green, blue, purple and maroon in the Summer. On a clear day – and we do have them – the flat top of Ben Nevis and the Glencoe range is to the north east, the twin peaks of Cruachan to the east, to the west Morven and the busy Glensanda Quarry, the largest in Europe, and the Isle of Mull to the south west. Beyond are the inner Hebrides, Islay and Jura.

The population of the island is at present about 170. We are a small, friendly community with a strong community spirit.

On the island you can find a medieval Parish Church, a Primary School and a Public Hall, as well as our most recent addition, the award-winning Gaelic Heritage Centre & Museum Gift Shop.

We have a well stocked island Shop & Post Office, and the fully licenced Isle of Lismore Cafe, situated at the Heritage Centre.

Advice from the government, theatre venues and schools closing mean it is no longer possible for the Festival to take place. Ensuring the health and wellbeing of our audience, performing companies, artists and staff has to remain our number one priority.

With a programme of 15 international productions, nearly a hundred Scottish artists performing at the Family Day and over 90% of schools tickets already booked, this year’s Festival was shaping up to be a real success. Our efforts will now focus on supporting the people we work with and finding innovative ways to deliver our year-round programme.

As a result, we are launching a special Ideas Fund to support artists and give them new opportunities to create work. These small grants will fund selected artists to develop creative ideas to occupy and inspire children and families isolated at home because of the virus. We are a small charity working with a range of artists making theatre and dance for young audiences and any help to support them weather this storm will be deeply appreciated. If you are in a position to, please donate here.

Festival Director Noel Jordan said:

“Our priority is now on supporting those we work with and minimising their potential loss of income. I want to ensure the cancellation of the Festival does not mean financial hardship for the small arts organisations, freelancers and independent artists we rely on to make our Festival the special event that it is. So we will honour the contracts of all those individuals who were confirmed to work on the Festival this year. We will also work with artists over the coming months to support them and to find artistic responses to the coronavirus situation. For now, we would like to thank our funders, partners, performing companies and audiences for their loyalty, support and understanding.’’

The Board of Directors would like to pay tribute to the hard work of the Imaginate team in developing this programme and to the many artists who were due to be involved in delivering the Festival."

Our focus at Rape Crisis during this exceptionally challenging period is working to minimise disruption for survivors accessing our services and to make sure anyone affected by sexual violence is able to reach out.

We have a responsibility to preserve the wellbeing of staff, survivors and the wider public, and to limit the spread of this virus.

That is why Rape Crisis Centres across Scotland have now stopped face to face support and have moved to support through phone, video or email. The exception to this rule is in Dundee where there is limited face to face contact for women accessing the Vice Versa service. If you are accessing Rape Crisis please contact your local centre to learn about any changes to local provision.

Some centres – particularly those in rural areas - are well used to using technology to help rise to geographical challenges but this is still an adjustment for us all. We are grateful for everyone’s patience as we work to resolve any technical issues that arise now, so that we can provide sustainable support throughout this situation.

In response to #COVID19 we are exploring how we can make support more accessible to you. Our helpline is still here, on the phone, by email and you can contact us by text. We want to make it as easy as possible for anyone affected by sexual violence to get in touch.

Call: 08088 01 03 02

Email: support@rapecrisisscotland.org.uk

Text: 07537 410027

To survivors: We know that this is a scary, uncertain and anxious situation and that many of the routines, coping mechanisms and distraction techniques that you rely on aren’t all possible right now. We are working on putting together some resources, but for now the only reassurance that we can offer is that this is temporary. This will not be forever, but for as long as it lasts and through the other side Rape Crisis will be right here with you.

Finally we want to send our deepest and heartfelt gratitude to all those carrying out essential work to bring an end to this crisis and to save lives, putting their own wellbeing at risk in doing so. Thank you.

Donald Morrison, Director at James Rizza & Sons, said: “Winning the competition offers both new and old customers the perfect opportunity to purchase our luxury product in take-home format from their local Scotmid store. We are thrilled that more people will have the chance to try our authentic Italian ice cream – a product we have worked hard to develop with locally sourced ingredients.

“We can’t wait to see Scotmid customers tuck into our ice cream as the days get hotter!”

Kirsty Carnegy, Head of Local Sourcing at Scotmid, said: “We are always looking for new ways to diversify and grow our Scottish product portfolio, it is really exciting to work with a brand that has such a strong heritage.

“A massive congratulations to Rizza’s!”

Wednesday 18th March
 
In an unprecedented move, Scotland’s Catholic bishops have announced that with effect from Thursday 19th March, no public Masses will be celebrated in Scotland. In a statement released today (Wednesday 18 March) the bishops announced, that priests would continue to celebrate Holy Mass in private, praying for those suffering from Covid-19 and those who care for them. Churches will remain open for personal prayer and parish priests are asked to welcome individuals who seek consolation and encouragement from the Lord and to be available for the reception of the Sacraments of Reconciliation, Anointing of the Sick and Holy Communion as and when they are needed especially for the sick and housebound. For the celebration of baptisms, funeral Masses and weddings the bishops ask that only close family are invited. 
 
The bishops’ statement encourages Catholics where possible to access the live streaming of Holy Mass from local parishes which have that facility. The bishops advise that Holy Week liturgies may be curtailed but ask Catholics to remain together in spirit and in prayer and to join with all Scotland’s Churches in a National Day of Prayer this Sunday 22nd March, Mothering Sunday, to pray for our country and our world in this time of need.

National Pastoral Letter and Statement from the Bishops’ Conference of Scotland
 
18th March 2020
 
Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,
 
In this time of trial, we, the Bishops of Scotland, wish to send you a word of reassurance and encouragement. We are all facing much uncertainty, anxiety and an unpredictable future. This situation touches on every aspect of our lives, individually and collectively. Sacred Scripture calls us repeatedly not to fear and to look to the help that comes to us from above. We are called to support one another in every way we can, especially those who are most vulnerable, through age or underlying conditions. Even in the midst of any necessary “distancing” we must stand by each other.
 
We ask you to pray for the sick, those caring for them, for those in positions of responsibility with difficult decisions to make, indeed for our whole country and the entire human family. Most of all, we are being asked to put our trust in the living God who has created everything to be and to flourish and whose providence guides the course of world events.  We put our trust in our Lord Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, and the true physician of our souls and bodies. 
 
During this Lent, especially, let us all take the opportunity to deepen our relationship with God. As your bishops and with our priests and deacons, we assure you of our continuing commitment to your spiritual, pastoral and sacramental needs. We want to maintain and foster the life of faith in every way we can, while also being informed by the advice and guidance of Government and health professionals. Over the centuries the Church has often been a source of comfort in times of trial and transformed sadness and fear into peace and joy. We want the same to happen now.
 
Given the official advice to reduce the spread of Covid-19, we have taken the difficult decision respecting the prudential judgement of each bishop to suspend Holy Mass in public for the time being from Thursday 19th March, the feast of St Joseph, Patron of the Universal Church. As pastors of the flocks entrusted to us, we are responding to an unprecedented crisis in modern times and assure all those whom we lead that this decision has not been taken without much prayer and discernment. 
 
Priests will continue to celebrate Holy Mass in private with the particular intention of praying for those suffering from Covid-19 and those who care for them. Our Churches will remain open for personal prayer and we would encourage parish priests to welcome individuals who seek consolation and encouragement from the Lord. We also ask our priests to be available for the reception of the Sacraments of Reconciliation, Anointing of the Sick and Holy Communion as and when they are needed especially for the sick and housebound.  
 
For the celebration of baptisms, funeral Masses and weddings we would ask that only close family are invited. We wish to remain close to and with our priests who are on the front line of pastoral care, as we remain close to the Lord, sure of that victory of Christ we celebrate at Easter. We encourage you where possible to access the live streaming of Holy Mass from the many parishes in our diocese and country which have that facility. 
 
Our celebration of Holy Week and the Sacred Triduum may indeed be curtailed by this government advice and we will seek means of celebrating those most important three days of the Mass of the Lord’s Supper, Good Friday and the Easter Vigil online so that they may be accessible in your own home. We will have the opportunity to be with one another in spirit and in prayer. Moreover, the Holy Father, Pope Francis will be celebrating the Sacred Triduum online from St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome and that celebration will unite us in prayer with all Catholics throughout the world.
 
We ask you to join with all the Churches in a National Day of Prayer this Sunday 22nd March, Mothering Sunday. It seems appropriate that as Catholics we pray together the Rosary, the prayer of our Blessed Mother Mary, at 12 noon, asking Her intercession for our country and our world in this time of need.  
 
On this coming Sunday also we were due to have our collection for the SCIAF Lenten Appeal, and it would be good if we could still show our concern for the poorest in the world, even in our own time of need, by sending our donations to SCIAF or making them on-line  to the SCIAF Wee Box Appeal at www.sciaf.org.uk.
 
As Government advice changes, we will update our guidance accordingly in the hope of restoring the public celebration of Mass. In the meantime, please ensure that no one feels abandoned in our communities and do what you can in practical terms to help those who are alone. We entrust all of you, especially those already afflicted by the virus and all health care professionals, to the care of Our Lady of Lourdes, Health of the Sick.

Bishops urge Catholics to reject ‘dangerous’ assisted suicide proposal 
25 April 2024
In a pastoral letter addressed to all Scotland’s Catholics, the bishops of Scotland ask them to urge their MSPs to reject the recently published assisted suicide proposals. The letter will be read out in all of Scotland’s 460 Catholic parishes, at all Masses on 27 & 28 April.
The bishops describe the proposal put forward by Liam McArthur MSP, as “dangerous” and call on MSPs to focus their energies on improving palliative care which the bishops say is “underfunded and limited”.
The letter states, that a law which “allows us to kill our brothers and sisters, takes us down a dangerous spiral that always puts at risk the most vulnerable members of our society, including the elderly, and disabled, and those who struggle with mental health”.
The pastoral letter cites evidence from other jurisdictions where assisted suicide is legal, including Oregon, where consistently around half of people who choose assisted suicide do so because they feel they are a burden on their families or on their communities and healthcare system.
“When vulnerable people, including the elderly and disabled, express concerns about being a burden”, say the bishops, “the appropriate response is not to suggest that they have a duty to die; rather, it is to commit to meeting their needs and providing the care and compassion they need to help them live”.
The bishops point out; “When our society is already marked by so many inequalities, we do not need assisted suicide to put intolerable pressure on our most disadvantaged who do not have a voice in this debate.”

Cut Off from Me, You Can Do Nothing 
Called to Care, Not to Kill – a Pastoral Letter on Assisted Suicide 
In the parable of the Vine and the Branches, Jesus teaches us that we are one community, one family and one society. We live in a world where any one of our decisions affects all of us. We are all brothers and sisters with responsibility to each other.
Living out our responsibilities for each other in our families, many of us will have had first-hand experience of being with loved ones as they passed from this world. It can be a harrowing and difficult experience, but it can also be a precious time of shared love and memories.
In the context of our responsibilities as a wider society, we are grateful to the medical, nursing and care staff who support our loved ones in their last weeks, days and hours. Sadly, however, palliative care is underfunded and limited in Scotland, and our Parliament should focus its energies on improving palliative care rather than on contemplating assisted suicide or euthanasia.
The private member’s bill to introduce assisted suicide for those aged sixteen and over, recently published in the Scottish Parliament, amounts to a rejection of the common responsibility we owe to each other and to those who are ill and dying.
Campaigners call it ‘assisted dying’ when what is really meant is assisted suicide. Palliative care and the process by which families and communities accompany and support those in the final moments of their lives is what we all usually mean by assisted dying. What is now being proposed is that doctors hand a lethal concoction of drugs to a patient to kill themselves. It is a direct, intentional action to end the patient’s life and truly crosses a Rubicon in Scotland.
In countries where assisted suicide has been legalised, palliative care provision has stalled and hospices which refuse to offer assisted suicide have had their funding cut or ...

Death of Fr Martin Chambers

The Bishop of Galloway, Bishop Frank Dougan has today announced that Fr Martin Chambers, a priest of the Diocese of Galloway who was shortly to be ordained as the new Bishop of the Diocese of Dunkeld, has died.
 
Bishop Dougan said:
 
“It was with a heavy heart and the deepest sadness that I learned today of the death of Fr. Martin Chambers, a priest of the Diocese of Galloway and the Bishop-Elect of the Diocese of Dunkeld. I know his family and the people of Galloway diocese who knew him and loved him will be deeply shocked and dismayed at his untimely death. Together we give thanks for the selfless service he gave to our diocese; we recognise the enormous contribution he made to support some of the poorest communities in Ecuador and we pray for the repose of his soul.”
 
“To know Martin was to know a man of love, enthusiasm, humour and a deep faith which enlivened all that he did.”
 
Bishop Dougan added:
 
“On behalf of the Diocese of Galloway I offer our deepest condolences and the promise of our prayers to Martin’s family as they come to terms with his loss, our prayers too are with the people of the Diocese of Dunkeld, who were preparing to welcome him as their bishop in two weeks’ time on 27 April. We give thanks to God for the great service of a selfless priest and pray for his eternal rest.”

Catholic Church responds to “damaging” Assisted Suicide Bill
Thursday 28 March 2024
 
 
The Catholic Church has responded to the publication of “The Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill” by Liam McArthur MSP. Bishop John Keenan, the Bishop of Paisley has described it as the introduction of “a dangerous idea that a citizen can lose their value and worth.”
Bishop Keenan adds; “Assisted suicide sends a message that there are situations when suicide is an appropriate response to one’s individual circumstances, worries, anxieties. It normalises suicide and accepts that some people are beyond hope.”

The full text of Bishop Keenan’s response is shown below.
 
 
Response to The Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill from Bishop John Keenan, Bishop of Paisley”
 
“Liberal Democrat MSP, Liam McArthur, has today published a damaging bill which attacks human dignity and introduces a dangerous idea that a citizen can lose their value and worth.
The Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill may refer to ‘assisted dying’, but this is a euphemistic term which doesn’t accurately describe the reality. Assisted dying is already practised by our health professionals and organisations, in the form of palliative care. An accurate term for what the Bill seeks to legalise is assisted suicide. It is a law which will allow a doctor to provide a patient with a lethal cocktail of drugs to kill themselves.
Implicit in assisted suicide is that the value of human life is measured by efficiency and utility and not by dignity. In crude terms, it means an individual can lose their value to society because of illness or disability. We are called to care for those who suffer, including those at the end of life. In this way, the appropriate response of civic society to suffering is not to facilitate death by prescription, but rather, to provide good, reliable care, including palliative care, for all those who need it.
Assisted suicide sends a message that there are situations when suicide is an appropriate response to one’s individual circumstances, worries, anxieties. It normalises suicide and accepts that some people are beyond hope.
Furthermore, assisted suicide undermines trust in doctors and damages the doctor- patient relationship. And in countries where assisted suicide is legal, there is evidence that vulnerable people, including the elderly and disabled, experience external pressure to end their lives. In Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal, it is common for around half of people to list fear of being a burden as one reason for hastening their death. It is little wonder that most major disability organisations in the UK are opposed to assisted suicide.
Assisted suicide is also uncontrollable. Every country where assisted suicide or euthanasia is legal has seen so-called ‘safeguards’ eroded and eligibility criteria expanded to include people with arthritis, anorexia, autism, dementia. And also, children.
When vulnerable people, including the elderly, poor and disabled, express concerns about being a burden, the appropriate response is not to suggest that they have a duty to die; rather, it is to commit to meeting their needs and providing the care and compassion they need to help them live.
This Bill has been introduced in Holy Week, when Christians reflect on the suffering, death and Resurrection of Jesus, the man who is their Lord and God and showed us what it means to be truly human. Where Liam McArthur’s Bill sees little point in human suffering and promotes the idea that a person’s life can become so hopeless as to be no longer worthwhile, this week is a timely reminder that when we support each other in suffering it can lead to a truly dignified death and offer the best of hope and possi...

Pope Francis appoints new Bishop of Dunkeld
2 February 2024
 
At 12 noon today (2 February 2024) in Rome (11am GMT) it was announced, that Pope Francis had nominated Fr. Martin Chambers as the new Bishop of the Diocese of Dunkeld. He will succeed Bishop Stephen Robson who was Bishop of Dunkeld from 2013 to 2022 when he retired on health grounds, since when it has been administered by Fr. Kevin Golden.
 
Reacting to his appointment, Fr. Martin said;“One of the catchphrases of Pope Francis is that, as Christians, we are called to be ‘Missionary Disciples’. The Pope reminds us that, yes, we are all called to take our part in the mission of spreading the Good News in our families and within our local community. However, the Pope reminds us that, first of all, we must sit as disciples at the feet of Jesus, listening to Him and letting Him guide our steps.”
 
“As I set out on this new Mission as Bishop of Dunkeld, I pledge to sit in prayer as a Disciple at the feet of Jesus, listening to his voice calling me forward in faith. Together, with Christ’s strength and inspiration, we will all be able to continue to build the Kingdom in the Diocese of Dunkeld.”
 
Fr. Martin added;
 
“I am also conscious that many years ago, I was accepted into seminary by Bishop Joseph McGee. He was the Bishop of Galloway who had started off as a priest of Dunkeld Diocese. In a strange way, I am returning a compliment in faith for, having started as a priest of Galloway, I am now becoming Bishop of Dunkeld.”
Responding to the news Diocesan Administrator Fr. Kevin Golden said:
“The whole community of the Diocese of Dunkeld will rejoice with me today at the appointment of Father Martin Chambers as our new Bishop. We assure him of a warm welcome as he comes among us and offer him our prayers and a steadfast commitment to working with him as he shepherds our Diocese into the future, inspired by the vision of our Holy Father Pope Francis. We renew our appreciation of the sterling work of our Bishop Emeritus, Stephen Robson.”
Welcoming the appointment of his successor, Bishop Robson said:
 
“I have known Fr Martin for many years since he was in the Sixth Form of Blairs College in 1981. Since then, I have followed with great admiration his journey in the priesthood thus far. He was educated in the Royal Scots College in Spain, and he has had great experience in Ecuador as a missionary priest. Various appointments as pastor, school chaplain and diocesan responsibilities in Galloway diocese then followed. All this previous experience will stand him in great stead going forward as bishop here in Dunkeld.
 
Personally I am delighted for Martin, and I know that the people, priests and religious of the diocese will welcome him with open arms.”

Catholic Church responds to “damaging” Assisted Suicide Bill
Thursday 28 March 2024
 
 
The Catholic Church has responded to the publication of “The Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill” by Liam McArthur MSP. Bishop John Keenan, the Bishop of Paisley has described it as the introduction of “a dangerous idea that a citizen can lose their value and worth.”
Bishop Keenan adds; “Assisted suicide sends a message that there are situations when suicide is an appropriate response to one’s individual circumstances, worries, anxieties. It normalises suicide and accepts that some people are beyond hope.”

Response to The Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill from Bishop John Keenan, Bishop of Paisley”
 
“Liberal Democrat MSP, Liam McArthur, has today published a damaging bill which attacks human dignity and introduces a dangerous idea that a citizen can lose their value and worth.
The Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill may refer to ‘assisted dying’, but this is a euphemistic term which doesn’t accurately describe the reality. Assisted dying is already practised by our health professionals and organisations, in the form of palliative care. An accurate term for what the Bill seeks to legalise is assisted suicide. It is a law which will allow a doctor to provide a patient with a lethal cocktail of drugs to kill themselves.
Implicit in assisted suicide is that the value of human life is measured by efficiency and utility and not by dignity. In crude terms, it means an individual can lose their value to society because of illness or disability. We are called to care for those who suffer, including those at the end of life. In this way, the appropriate response of civic society to suffering is not to facilitate death by prescription, but rather, to provide good, reliable care, including palliative care, for all those who need it.
Assisted suicide sends a message that there are situations when suicide is an appropriate response to one’s individual circumstances, worries, anxieties. It normalises suicide and accepts that some people are beyond hope.
Furthermore, assisted suicide undermines trust in doctors and damages the doctor- patient relationship. And in countries where assisted suicide is legal, there is evidence that vulnerable people, including the elderly and disabled, experience external pressure to end their lives. In Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal, it is common for around half of people to list fear of being a burden as one reason for hastening their death. It is little wonder that most major disability organisations in the UK are opposed to assisted suicide.
Assisted suicide is also uncontrollable. Every country where assisted suicide or euthanasia is legal has seen so-called ‘safeguards’ eroded and eligibility criteria expanded to include people with arthritis, anorexia, autism, dementia. And also, children.
When vulnerable people, including the elderly, poor and disabled, express concerns about being a burden, the appropriate response is not to suggest that they have a duty to die; rather, it is to commit to meeting their needs and providing the care and compassion they need to help them live.
This Bill has been introduced in Holy Week, when Christians reflect on the suffering, death and Resurrection of Jesus, the man who is their Lord and God and showed us what it means to be truly human. Where Liam McArthur’s Bill sees little point in human suffering and promotes the idea that a person’s life can become so hopeless as to be no longer worthwhile, this week is a timely reminder that when we support each other in suffering it can lead to a truly dignified death and offer the best of hope and possi...

Pope Francis appoints new Bishop of Dunkeld
2 February 2024
 
At 12 noon today (2 February 2024) in Rome (11am GMT) it was announced, that Pope Francis had nominated Fr. Martin Chambers as the new Bishop of the Diocese of Dunkeld. He will succeed Bishop Stephen Robson who was Bishop of Dunkeld from 2013 to 2022 when he retired on health grounds, since when it has been administered by Fr. Kevin Golden.
 
Reacting to his appointment, Fr. Martin said;“One of the catchphrases of Pope Francis is that, as Christians, we are called to be ‘Missionary Disciples’. The Pope reminds us that, yes, we are all called to take our part in the mission of spreading the Good News in our families and within our local community. However, the Pope reminds us that, first of all, we must sit as disciples at the feet of Jesus, listening to Him and letting Him guide our steps.”
 
“As I set out on this new Mission as Bishop of Dunkeld, I pledge to sit in prayer as a Disciple at the feet of Jesus, listening to his voice calling me forward in faith. Together, with Christ’s strength and inspiration, we will all be able to continue to build the Kingdom in the Diocese of Dunkeld.”
 
Fr. Martin added;
 
“I am also conscious that many years ago, I was accepted into seminary by Bishop Joseph McGee. He was the Bishop of Galloway who had started off as a priest of Dunkeld Diocese. In a strange way, I am returning a compliment in faith for, having started as a priest of Galloway, I am now becoming Bishop of Dunkeld.”
Responding to the news Diocesan Administrator Fr. Kevin Golden said:
“The whole community of the Diocese of Dunkeld will rejoice with me today at the appointment of Father Martin Chambers as our new Bishop. We assure him of a warm welcome as he comes among us and offer him our prayers and a steadfast commitment to working with him as he shepherds our Diocese into the future, inspired by the vision of our Holy Father Pope Francis. We renew our appreciation of the sterling work of our Bishop Emeritus, Stephen Robson.”
Welcoming the appointment of his successor, Bishop Robson said:
 
“I have known Fr Martin for many years since he was in the Sixth Form of Blairs College in 1981. Since then, I have followed with great admiration his journey in the priesthood thus far. He was educated in the Royal Scots College in Spain, and he has had great experience in Ecuador as a missionary priest. Various appointments as pastor, school chaplain and diocesan responsibilities in Galloway diocese then followed. All this previous experience will stand him in great stead going forward as bishop here in Dunkeld.
 
Personally I am delighted for Martin, and I know that the people, priests and religious of the diocese will welcome him with open arms.”

Bishops urge Catholics to reject ‘dangerous’ assisted suicide proposal 
25 April 2024
In a pastoral letter addressed to all Scotland’s Catholics, the bishops of Scotland ask them to urge their MSPs to reject the recently published assisted suicide proposals. The letter will be read out in all of Scotland’s 460 Catholic parishes, at all Masses on 27 & 28 April.
The bishops describe the proposal put forward by Liam McArthur MSP, as “dangerous” and call on MSPs to focus their energies on improving palliative care which the bishops say is “underfunded and limited”.
The letter states, that a law which “allows us to kill our brothers and sisters, takes us down a dangerous spiral that always puts at risk the most vulnerable members of our society, including the elderly, and disabled, and those who struggle with mental health”.
The pastoral letter cites evidence from other jurisdictions where assisted suicide is legal, including Oregon, where consistently around half of people who choose assisted suicide do so because they feel they are a burden on their families or on their communities and healthcare system.
“When vulnerable people, including the elderly and disabled, express concerns about being a burden”, say the bishops, “the appropriate response is not to suggest that they have a duty to die; rather, it is to commit to meeting their needs and providing the care and compassion they need to help them live”.
The bishops point out; “When our society is already marked by so many inequalities, we do not need assisted suicide to put intolerable pressure on our most disadvantaged who do not have a voice in this debate.”

Cut Off from Me, You Can Do Nothing 
Called to Care, Not to Kill – a Pastoral Letter on Assisted Suicide 
In the parable of the Vine and the Branches, Jesus teaches us that we are one community, one family and one society. We live in a world where any one of our decisions affects all of us. We are all brothers and sisters with responsibility to each other.
Living out our responsibilities for each other in our families, many of us will have had first-hand experience of being with loved ones as they passed from this world. It can be a harrowing and difficult experience, but it can also be a precious time of shared love and memories.
In the context of our responsibilities as a wider society, we are grateful to the medical, nursing and care staff who support our loved ones in their last weeks, days and hours. Sadly, however, palliative care is underfunded and limited in Scotland, and our Parliament should focus its energies on improving palliative care rather than on contemplating assisted suicide or euthanasia.
The private member’s bill to introduce assisted suicide for those aged sixteen and over, recently published in the Scottish Parliament, amounts to a rejection of the common responsibility we owe to each other and to those who are ill and dying.
Campaigners call it ‘assisted dying’ when what is really meant is assisted suicide. Palliative care and the process by which families and communities accompany and support those in the final moments of their lives is what we all usually mean by assisted dying. What is now being proposed is that doctors hand a lethal concoction of drugs to a patient to kill themselves. It is a direct, intentional action to end the patient’s life and truly crosses a Rubicon in Scotland.
In countries where assisted suicide has been legalised, palliative care provision has stalled and hospices which refuse to offer assisted suicide have had their funding cut or ...

Death of Fr Martin Chambers
10 April 2024
 
The Bishop of Galloway, Bishop Frank Dougan has today announced that Fr Martin Chambers, a priest of the Diocese of Galloway who was shortly to be ordained as the new Bishop of the Diocese of Dunkeld, has died.
 
Bishop Dougan said:
 
“It was with a heavy heart and the deepest sadness that I learned today of the death of Fr. Martin Chambers, a priest of the Diocese of Galloway and the Bishop-Elect of the Diocese of Dunkeld. I know his family and the people of Galloway diocese who knew him and loved him will be deeply shocked and dismayed at his untimely death. Together we give thanks for the selfless service he gave to our diocese; we recognise the enormous contribution he made to support some of the poorest communities in Ecuador and we pray for the repose of his soul.”
 
“To know Martin was to know a man of love, enthusiasm, humour and a deep faith which enlivened all that he did.”
 
Bishop Dougan added:
 
“On behalf of the Diocese of Galloway I offer our deepest condolences and the promise of our prayers to Martin’s family as they come to terms with his loss, our prayers too are with the people of the Diocese of Dunkeld, who were preparing to welcome him as their bishop in two weeks’ time on 27 April. We give thanks to God for the great service of a selfless priest and pray for his eternal rest.”

If you have booked tickets for an upcoming performance, please bear with us as we contact everyone regarding refunds. We will continue to monitor the situation closely, following the appropriate advice.

We are already beginning to work with our network of brilliant storytellers, musicians and performers across Scotland to develop alternative ways of promoting and celebrating the great work that they do. Please keep an eye on our website and social media channels for further updates on this.

The Storytelling Centre is a community space, in many, many ways. We exist to celebrate the stories that humans share, to give opportunities for creative spirits and to carry on the traditions that generations before have taught us, learning from them and adding to them as we go along the carrying stream. This is our story just now.

If you have any questions, please contact us by email at [email protected]

Take care and stay safe,

Here is some advice for property buyers, sellers and homeowners. We will update this page as regularly as we are able to with new information and the latest advice.

As of Monday 21st March 2022, the Scottish Government confirmed the removal of all legal requirements regarding Covid-19, with the exception of requirements to wear face coverings on public transport and in most indoor settings - this includes when working in other peoples' homes. These requirements are likely to stay in place until early April 2022.

This means that the specific Covid-19 guidance on home moves will be removed.

Open viewings may have limits placed on the number of attendees at any one time, the selling agent will advise buyers and sellers on the recommended protocols in place to reduce the risks of spreading Covid-19.

Prior to attending any property viewing or any public gathering, attendees are advised to take a lateral flow test. It is still encouraged to follow certain protocols during viewings, including opening windows and doors for ventilation, hand washing and respiratory hygiene.

Read the full update strategic framework from the Scottish Government here.

If you choose to attend a physical viewing of a property, it is important that buyers, sellers and selling agents should continue to wear face coverings indoors and adhere to hand hygiene guidelines. Prior to attending any property viewing, attendees are advised to take a lateral flow test.

The Scottish Government advises that all parties involved in home buying and selling should agree to be as flexible as possible to accommodate any changes in circumstance, dates or progress due to COVID-19.

We have answered some commonly asked questions below to provide advice to those looking to buy or sell a home.

You can find information and advice for landlords here and information and advice for tenants here.

If you are identified as a household contact of a positive COVID-19 case, you must follow current guidance on testing and self-isolation periods.

When attending a viewing you should adhere to government guidance on hand washing and respiratory hygiene. The Scottish Government also advises wearing a face covering and avoiding touching surfaces while inside a property. You should also ensure that you have taken a lateral flow test prior to attending a property viewing.

Can I get my property valued?

In-person property valuations are permitted, so agents can come to your property to do a valuation. All parties should adhere to government guidance on hand washing, social distancing and respiratory hygiene. Selling agents are legally required to wear a face covering unless medically exempt.

Can I apply for a new mortgage?

You can still apply for a new mortgage, but some lenders have tightened up loan-to-value ratios and require a larger deposit than usual. However, there are lenders who are still accepting lower deposits and there are also schemes available that may help you get on the property ladder with a smaller deposit, such as the 95% mortgage guarantee scheme. It is best to speak to an independent mortgage adviser to find out what your options are.

Aberdeen life sciences firm NovaBiotics plans to test one of its drugs on Covid-19 patients with secondary lung infections.

Nylexa 'supercharges' antibiotics to help them tackle difficult to treat and drug-resistant bacteria. Many of the lung infections in Covid-19 patients do not respond to antibiotics and more than half of the patients who died in Hubei province, the epicentre of the pandemic in China, succumbed to a secondary bacterial infection or sepsis.

NovaBiotics could begin making Nylexa for trials in May and in partnership with the NHS and subject to regulatory approvals, clinical studies could get under way soon after on patients hospitalised with Covid-19.

Chief executive Deborah O’Neil said: “The impact of bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance in Covid-19 is beyond doubt. While vaccine development continues for the longer term, it is critical to develop rapidly deployable strategies to prevent deaths and long term health issues from secondary bacterial infections caused by Sars-CoV-2. These infections could still be fatal regardless of antiviral or other experimental treatment.

""Nylexa is a low risk, low cost, readily available candidate treatment that could be tested and deployed to combat the coronavirus pandemic very quickly.”

The active ingredient of Nylexa has proven to be safe and effective in clinical studies carried out across the UK, Italy and the US for bacterial lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). Nylexa could be repositioned as a Covid-19 therapy and tested on patients in the second half of 2020, ahead of any vaccine being available.

Professor Dilip Nathwani OBE, consultant physician and Emeritus Honorary Professor of Infection, University of Dundee, said: “Secondary bacterial infections have been long recognised as an important and devastating cause of mortality in patients with primary viral pneumonia. In my 30 years of clinical practice, despite the administration of timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy to cover against these secondary bacterial infections, I have seen a significant number of patients tragically still succumb to the infection. This is supported from data emerging during the Covid-19 crisis.

""Therefore, during this current pandemic of Covid-19 respiratory infections, the need to consider and test antibiotics that offer alternative and complimentary modes of action are of worthwhile and of critical importance. I believe Nylexa may be such a potential treatment requiring urgent assessment of its efficacy. Its evaluation needs to be now.”"

The protease enzyme found in SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for breaking down proteins by disrupting their chemical bonds.
For COVID-19, this protease is potentially a highly promising drug target.
Dr Yogesh Kulathu is the programme lead for the University of Dundee lab that is working out how to block the enzyme responsible for the coronavirus’ ability to replicate so effectively.
Blocking its function could lead to an efficacious drug to treat COVID-19 and related diseases that may arise in the future.","drug, researchers, enzyme, protein, sarscov2, virus, approach, covid19, tackle, responsible, protease, viral, target, dundee","University of Dundee researchers are studying a protein that aids the spread of COVID-19 in the hope of finding ways of blocking its function.

The team, from the University’s Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit (MRC PPU) are working in partnership with the School of Life Sciences Drug Discovery Unit (DDU) to study an enzyme found within the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 infection.

Enzymes are responsible for increasing the speed of reactions and have the ability to build up or break down other molecules. The protease enzyme found in SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for breaking down proteins by disrupting their chemical bonds.

When the protease breaks down the viral proteins it changes their size and shape which starts a chain of reactions that allows the virus to replicate. This protease also interferes with the immune responses that cells mount against the virus to block viral replication and spread. For COVID-19, this protease is potentially a highly promising drug target.

COVID-19 shows similarities to other coronavirus infections that have been faced over the years, however, there is currently a lack of understanding of SARS-CoV-2 structure and function.

Dr Yogesh Kulathu is the programme lead for the University of Dundee lab that is working out how to block the enzyme responsible for the coronavirus’ ability to replicate so effectively.

He said, “Studies with the related SARS-CoV virus that emerged in 2002, suggest that vaccines targeting the spike protein may not be an effective approach to provide protection. Hence novel targets are required to tackle this virus.

“Our approach is to target an enzyme that the virus makes and relies on for its assembly and capacity to infect cells. Blocking its function could lead to an efficacious drug to treat COVID-19 and related diseases that may arise in the future.

“Our work provides a complementary approach to antibody and vaccine strategies conventionally developed to combat viral infections."

This guidance is regularly updated and this live article provides the most up to date advice.

Current situation

If you've had the vaccine (or booster) as part of the UK vaccination programme, you can book in to give blood 48hrs after your jab .

You need to make an appointment to give blood at any donation session in Scotland.

It is no longer mandatory to wear a face mask when you come to give blood.

Physical distancing will be removed across all donation sessions.

We encourage the use of alcohol-based hand rub which will be available at session.

Please make an extra special effort to give blood over the coming days, weeks and months. If you are fit and well and have not been impacted by Covid-19, it's important to come forward and donate.

Am I eligible to donate?

As always, our usual donor eligibility criteria apply - see Can I give blood? for more information. However, there are also a number of criteria in place with regards to Covid-19.

You must not donate if you fall into any of the following categories:

You have Covid-19 confirmed by a positive test (PCR or LFT)

You have suspected Covid-19 and are waiting for the results of a PCR test arranged by your doctor or other health care provider

You have Post-Covid Syndrome, also known as Long Covid

If you have symptoms but haven’t been tested for Covid-19 or have had a negative test result for Covid-19 then whether you can donate will depend on your symptoms.

Please do not come to session if you have symptoms of Covid-19, flu or other common respiratory infections. These may include:

continuous cough

high temperature, fever or chills

new loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell

shortness of breath

unexplained tiredness, lack of energy

muscle aches or pains that are not due to exercise

not wanting to eat or not feeling hungry

headache that is unusual or longer lasting than usual

sore throat, stuffy or runny nose

diarrhoea, feeling sick or being sick

If you have any of these symptoms, please let us know, so we can re-allocate your appointment to someone else.

Post-Covid Syndrome or Long Covid is diagnosed when someone has Covid-19 symptoms that last for more than 12 weeks.

If you have any queries regarding this, please give us a call on 0345 90 90 999.

When will I be eligible to donate?

If you have tested positive for Covid-19 you must wait at least seven days after recovery from your symptoms

If you have tested positive but haven’t had symptoms, you must wait at least seven days after your last positive test

If you have had Long Co v id, you won’t be able to donate until you have been fully recovered for six months

Recovery from Covid-19

If you have had Covid-19 you must be fully recovered before giving blood.

This means you must:

have returned to normal activities

not have ongoing Covid-19 symptoms including fatigue

not be undergoing tests or follow up



The only exception to this is for a change to taste or smell, as this can continue even after someone has recovered from Covid-19.

I've had my Covid-19 vaccination/booster. Can I donate?

If you've had a Covid-19 vaccine (or booster vaccine) you can book in to give blood immediately provided you don't have any side effects from the vaccination.

If you've got a blood donation appointment booked before your vaccination appointment, you can still come to donate.

Please contact us on 0345 90 90 999 if, after you've donated:

you feel unwell (including any symptoms of Covid-19)

you suffer any discomfort or problems after giving blood

you have doubts at any time after donating about whether your blood should be used for patients.

Where can I find out more?

NHS Inform have created an excellent resource on Covid-19, including a symptom checker, information about information treatments and vaccines, and advice on Long Covid.

What is coronavirus (COVID-19)?

There are many sources of information about COVID-19. All charities should read this guidance from the Scottish Government.

The guidance includes advice for non-healthcare settings, and has tips that apply to people working in hospitality settings, leisure facilities, entertainment venues and premises used by community groups. NHS inform will give you the latest public health advice.

One of the most important things is the basic hygiene measures that you can take to help prevent the spread of the infection. These include:

routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched objects and surfaces such as telephones, keyboards, door handles, desks and tables

basic hand washing is highlighted as the most effective way of preventing the spread of infection. Hand hygiene promoted by ensuring staff, contractors, service users and visitors have access to hand washing facilities and alcohol-based hand rub, where available

crockery and cutlery in shared kitchen areas should be cleaned with warm water and detergent and dried thoroughly

ensuring food such as crisps and sandwiches should not be left open for communal sharing unless individually wrapped.

COVID-19 guidance for charities

For charities, there are some specific concerns that we have become aware of, and we have covered these in our COVID-19 guidance for charities.

Well, they have wanted to have a little chat with him for a while, but they actually filed a ‘Mutual Legal Assistance’ request. This “moves Andrew into the realms of a criminal investigation”.

Someone posted it on twitter last night and I asked for a source. Apparently The Sun broke the story (I’m not linking to them here) and it was later covered by the Metro, Sky News and others.

So I kept looking at the BBC website. Nothing.

And again this morning, nothing.

This potentially enormous story. Nothing.

Then I looked at the BBC page that covers the daily headlines in the newspapers. That link is the one for 8th June. Even though they normally cover The Sun and occasionally The Metro, there is nothing from them on the page. They preferred to mention something about Bugs Bunny in the Daily Mail.

Later on, a BBC story about it did come online. If you decide to read it, you may want to note that it is more or less ENTIRELY from the point of view of Andrew and his lawyers.

Why the initial silence? Then why would they have decided to publish an article on it from that angle?

Do you think the BBC would do that for everyone? Or is it more likely that the defence of the British State is interwoven into the fabric of the BBC?

Here is an interesting little clip in that regard, a different situation, definitely, but a similar theme…"

By which time Alister will be in his late 90s and most of those who voted against independence in 2014 will be as dead as the Johnson government’s claim to be a competent administration already is.

In response to this petulant denial of the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future Nicola Sturgeon tweeted:

As we’re seeing across the Atlantic just now, politicians who rage against democracy don’t prevail. Let’s not dignify this rubbish. Instead let’s keep making and winning the case for independence. Power doesn’t belong to politicians – it belongs to the people. and this is unarguably true. it matters as little as Douglas Ross’s promises to stand up for Scotland against Johnson if Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond had sworn a solemn vow on the front page of the Daily Record on faux parchment paper that they would not seek another referendum until all the weans that Johnson admits to had weans of their own – which they most certainly didn’t but while certain BBC journalists seem happy to to propagate the myth that ‘once in a generation’ was an actual promise made by the Yes campaign or the SNP? it was not a thing that actually happened. Yet even if it had happened it doesn’t matterbecause no politician in a democracy can bind the hands of the electorate. Yet that is exactly what the Tories are proposing to do, on the basis of a mere six chips seats in the House of Commons they are taking it for themselves the right to tell the people of Scotland what we can or cannot vote for. They are not, as they so misleadingly and mendaciously claim, holding the SNP to account, they are limiting the democratic right of the people of Scotland to choose the form of Government best suited to their needs. And if that is indeed the case then Scotland must ask itself if this really is a union because if we are to be forbidden from asking ourselves if we wish to remain in this so called union then it is not a partnership in any meaningful sense of the term. It is a set of shackles on Scotland’s dreams and aspirations.https://twitter.com/docrobperry/status/1325104687377510402

Surprise Surprise Who should leap to the defence of The Tories denying Scottish democracy but the BBC’s very own, ahem, impartial political editor Laura Conservative sources tell me, Kuenssberg. Well I say surprise, That’s surprise as in The Tories have outraged public opinion again, but to everyone’s surprise Baroness don’t call me baroness Davidson is nowhere to be found. Or surprise as in- to the immense surprise of the viewing public The Prime minister gave a speech during which he told numerous lies, none of which Laura called him out on

The BBC’s ‘impartial’ political editor replied in a way which managed to miss the point entirely, saying: One US politician making wild allegations about fraud is obviously not the same as another in the UK hardening their opposition to another kind of poll taking place which the UK government has the legal right to permit or not. And here we see yet again the BBC uncritically repeating the attack lines of the Tories as though they were established facts. It is not a fact that Scotland can only have another vote on independence with Westminster’s consent. The only fact is that the lawfulness of a consultative referendum without a Section 30 order has never been legally clarified. And it is certainly the case that a Scottish plebiscite election on independence would absolutely be lawful. But you’d never know any of that from listening to the BBC.

it is however a fact that the BBC is to opposition to Scottish independence as Fox News is, or rather was, to Donald Trump.Over the past couple of days even Fox News has been treating Trump’s claims with an appropriate degree of scepticism, We can only dream of the BBC ever doing the same with the anti-independence claims of British nationalism in Scotland.Trump had Fox news, the BBC is ForUKs news.

Mesnwhile the favourit political comic of Tory Brextremism, The Spectator, responded to the legitimate claim that by denying Scottish democracy with a risible piece from Matt Kilcoyne, the deputy director of the Adam Smith Institute which used tactics direct from the Trumpian playbook to assert thait was Nicola Sturgeon who is not so different from Trump. The Adam Smith Institute is of course one of those shadowy right wing ‘think tanks’, which the BBC likes to trot out as neutral and objective whenever it publishes something which The Tories hope is damaging to the independence cause.

The article was exactly like a Trump speech, rambling exercise in self pity and victimhood claiming founded on baseless assertions an lies, such as the following claim”for Sturgeon, there is no societal ill that cannot be blamed on the English. Just recently, she enjoyed claiming, without any evidence, that coronavirus was spread to Scotland in the summer by the plague-ridden English”. This is, as anyone who has been paying attention knows, complete and utter bullshit , The First Minister has resisted demands to close the Border to visitors from England, and has never blamed outbreaks of the virus in Scotland on The English, but that doesn’t suit Matt’s victimhood seeking narrative. Clearly opponents of independence have adopted another tactic from the Trump playbook. They have given up trying to appeal to the middle ground and are now playing solely to their constantly shrinking base

now I am just waiting for a Spectator article from Stephen Daisley telling us why a Biden presidency, Or indeed a two for one offer on square slice in Morrisons means that it’s all over for the SNP – it was over for the Trump Presidency when the election was called for Biden just as Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani was giving a press conference in the car park outside the four seasons landscaping company in Philadelphia. Rudy stood in front of a chemical waste warning sign and uttered baseless lies that the American media has now resolved to ignore. Would that the Scottish media were aswilling to be sceptical of the claims of British nationalism. But no.Today we have the Herald warning us that Scotland can’t get rid of Trident and then go on to join NATO despite the fact that in the late 1970s Spain did exactly what Scotland is being told is impossible. Spain got rid of the American nukes at the U?S base in Rota near Cadiz and a couple of years later went on to join NATO naturally there was no mention of this clearly germane information in the Herald piece, which instead acted as an uncritical platform to amplify the claims of an opponent of independence. 2014 called, it wants its scare story back.

It transpires that Trump wanted the press conference in the four seasons hotel and had already Tweeted out the location when the hotel refused to host the event and Trump’s staff desperately cast about for a way of saving the shameless one’s face. so they settled on the car park of a run down landscaping shop in a seedy part of town, situated between an adult store selling dildos and a crematorium.It turned out t be a fitting end for Trump’s presidency, right next to one place where you can go and get fucked and another where you go when you die. British nationalism in Scotland is going the same way. It has become risible, pathetic and a bit of a joke which is unable to accept that the game is up.

Lanarkshire firm Lamellar Biomedical says one of its treatments could help save lives by halting progression of lung damage in Covid-19 patients.

The company has pre-clinical evidence that Lamellasome can protect lung cells and tissue if inhaled within five to eight days of symptoms of respiratory lung disease.

It says early intervention can prevent the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) seen in coronavirus patients.

Lamellar chairman Dr Duncan Moore said: “In the past few weeks we have seen the terrible consequences Covid-19 can have on the respiratory function, particularly on vulnerable patient populations.

""We believe that that the inherent attributes of Lamellasone are extremely well suited to be a potential approach to preventing the onset of the serious respiratory symptoms seen in Covid-19 patients.

""Lamellar is focused on treating complex lung disorders and we believe that our Lamellasome formulations could make an important difference to patients and healthcare providers globally.”

Lamellar, based at Eurocentral near Motherwell, was founded in 2007, with the aim of developing an early-stage treatment for the lung disease Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis but it has applications for other lung conditions.

Lamellosome can be used to reduce inflammation or as a vehicle to deliver other drugs.

Investors include Invesco, Scottish Enterprise, Barwell Plc, TRI Capital and it works in partnership with the universities of Edinburgh and Strathclyde.

Dr Nik Hirani, Reader in Respiratory Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Lamellar has very convincing data demonstrating strong in-vivo efficacy for Lamellasome formulations in a model relevant to pneumonitis, lung injury and ARDS. I have been following the development of Lamellosome technology and its development as a respiratory therapeutic over the past few years, and I believe it has real potential to manage the inflammatory respiratory symptoms seen in patients infected with SARS-CoV2.”"

Latest Scottish Government Guidance

Scotland's revised strategic framework

The Scottish Government have unveiled a “revised strategic framework” in the form of four phases, which details how restrictions will be gradually lifted in the country. The different phases, with indicative dates, are:



First phase - between now and early March The Scottish Government have unveiled a “revised strategic framework” in the form of four phases, which details how restrictions will be gradually lifted in the country. The different phases, with indicative dates, are:

The first easing started on 22 February with the phased return of schools, Ms Sturgeon said.

Universities and colleges are also able to bring back a small number of students for critical face-to-face teaching.

Restrictions on care home visiting will also be eased from early March.

Second phase - indicatively 15 March

The next phase of the school return could happen from 15 March, starting with primary years four to seven and more senior phase secondary pupils at least part-time.

Outdoors non-contact group sports for 12 to 17-year-olds could restart then.

The limit on outdoor mixing between households could also be increased to four people from a maximum of two households.

Third phase - indicatively 5 April

The “stay at home” restriction could be lifted from 5 April.

It is hoped that the final phase of the school return could also happen then.

Communal worship could restart on this date, but with restricted numbers.

Restrictions on outdoor gatherings may also be eased so six people from two households could meet up.

Retailers could start to reopen from this date, beginning with an extension of “essential retail” services and the removal of click-and-collect restrictions.

Last phase - indicatively 26 April

If the data allows, Scotland will move back into the levels system with the hope that the whole country will move into Level 3.

The First Minister has suggested that there might be parts of the country - perhaps more rural communities - that are able to go straight to level 2.

A “phased but significant” reopening of the economy could happen on this date, with non-essential retail opening back up.

Hospitality - bars, restaurants and pubs - may also reopen then, as well as services like gyms and hairdressers.

Guidance on Stay at Home Regulations

Guidance on new stay at home regulations came into effect on 5 January 2021. Further details of the latest restrictions can be viewed by clicking here.

Key Changes include:

changing the 6/2 rule to a 2/2 rule. A maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors. Children aged 11 and under will not be counted in that limit

changing the 6/2 rule to a 2/2 rule. A maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors. Children aged 11 and under will not be counted in that limit for everyone else – including 12 to 17 year olds – outdoor exercise or recreation should only take place in a way which is consistent with the 2/2 rule

under 12s will not count towards the 2/2 rule and will continue to be able to participate in organised activities outdoors

all schools to continue to use remote learning until the end of January, except in the case of vulnerable children and those of key workers

stronger guidance on working from home is reflected in new guidance for people who are shielding. Those who are shielding and who cannot work from home are now advised not to work.

On 21st May 2020 the Scottish Government published its’ ‘Route Map Through and Out of the Crisis’.

To support a safe re-start, the Scottish Government has also begun to issue guidance for specific sectors:

Guidance for the tourism and hospitality sector, published 18th June. This includes information on assessing risk, workforce planning and training, as well as an operational checklist. This offers a usable guide for businesses to follow to ensure that they have made sufficient provisions for the health and safety of their staff and customers.

Guidance for the construction sector. More information on the ‘Construction Restart Plan’ can also be found here. This details what works can restart and how, now that we are moving into Phase 2 of the Scottish Governments Routemap.

Guidance for the retail sector has also been published. This guidance includes details on procedures for staff and customer safety and an operations checklist for businesses re-opening. This has come into effect immediately, and extends until further notice with regular reviews in line with lockdown plans.

Guidance for the manufacturing sector is now available. This sets out Scottish Government expectations on what manufacturers of all sizes and sub-sectors need to consider when they restart and, in the case of the manufacture of essential goods where companies have remained open, it establishes a framework for ongoing action to ensure those workplaces continue to change and operate safely.

New guidance for passengers and operators in Scotland was announced on 26 May by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, as part of the Transport Transition Plan. Face coverings will also be mandatory on public transport from Monday 22 June, as part of operators’ preparations for progress towards recovery and to reduce the risk of transmission. It will apply to all passengers and staff in public areas, although there will be exemptions especially for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specific medical reasons. Children under five will also be exempt.

Through our links with Scottish Chambers of Commerce, we are playing an active role in informing and shaping the Sector Guidance. If you’d like to feed into this process, please contact info@melcc.org.uk This is also the place to send any views you have on Scotland’s exit planning, and to share what support your business or sector needs to ensure you can safely and securely restart operations as soon as government guidelines allow."

You can read our report here. Part of the outdated patchwork of laws that restrict women’s reproductive rights is the little-known Concealment of Birth Act. In this blog, expert Dr Emma Milne explores how the Act criminalises vulnerable women and why we need action to create a system that puts women’s needs first. Posted on November 7 2024 at 12:44

Modernising Scotland's abortion law Today we launch our new report, 1. The law is in urgent need of modernisation. Today we launch our new report, ‘Outdated, harmful and never in the public interest - The urgent need to modernise Scotland's abortion law and prevent prosecutions.’ Here’s why...1. The law is in urgent need of modernisation. The legal framework which currently governs when an abortion is permitted is made up of a patchwork of laws that stem from as far back as the 17th century. These measures largely reflect the eras in which they were introduced, and the degrees of patriarchal control women were subject to at the time. Put another way, one of these laws was first introduced at a time when witch trials were still happening. Posted on May 22 2024 at 08:00

Rather, when prompted, he discussed herd immunity in relation to the belief that COVID-19 will endure long enough to become as common as seasonal flu.

This initial focus took attention away from a much more profound discussion of what the UK government thinks is feasible, which informs a very stark choice: to define the COVID-19 problem as (a) a short term pandemic to be eradicated (as in countries like South Korea) or (b) a long term pandemic to be expected and managed every year (the definition in countries like the UK).

There is no ‘herd immunity strategy’

The key thing to note is that ministers and their advisors:

Did talk in general terms about the idea of ‘herd immunity’ in March (best summed up as: herd immunity is only possible if there is a vaccine or enough people are infected and recover)

Did not recommend an extreme non-intervention policy in which most of the population would be infected quickly to achieve herd immunity (in February, advisers described this outcome as the Reasonable Worst Case Scenario; see also Whitty, 5.3.20: q15-17)

Rather, describing the idea of herd immunity as an inevitability (not determined by choice) is key to understanding the UK approach. It helps us question the idea that there was a big policy U-turn in mid-March. Policy did change in the short term, but a sole focus on the short term distracts from the profound implications of its long-term strategy (in the absence of a vaccine) associated with phrases such as ‘flatten the curve’ (rather than ‘eradicate the virus’).

Examples of UK government representatives talking about herd immunity

1. Wilful misrepresentation, often put to music

Full Fact’s challenge to the wilful misrepresentation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s appearance on the ITV programme This Morning (10.3.20): Here is the transcript of what Boris Johnson said on This Morning about the new coronavirus

These video stinkers, in which people (a) cut quotes so that you don’t hear the context, and provide a misleading headline, or (b) put a bunch of cut interviews in sequence and combine them with a tune that sounds like a knock-off version of the end credits to the TV Series The Hulk (in other words, people design these messages to get an emotional reaction).

2. Headlines stoking the idea of herd immunity during a time when everyone should have been careful about how explain and interpret early discussions

British government wants UK to acquire coronavirus ‘herd immunity’, writes Robert Peston (12.3.20)

3. The accentuation of a message not being emphasised by government spokespeople, at the expense of a message that requires more attention.

This interview is described by Sky News (13.3.20) as: ‘The government’s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has told Sky News that about 60% of people will need to become infected with coronavirus in order for the UK to enjoy “herd immunity”’. You might be forgiven for thinking that he was on Sky extolling the virtues of a strategy to that end. This was certainly the write-up in respected papers like the FT (UK’s chief scientific adviser defends ‘herd immunity’ strategy for coronavirus). Yet, he was saying nothing of the sort. Rather, when prompted, he discussed herd immunity in relation to the belief that COVID-19 will endure long enough to become as common as seasonal flu.

See Vallance’s interview on the same day (13.3.20) during Radio 4’s Today programme (transcribed by the Spectator and headlined as “How ‘herd immunity’ can help fight coronavirus” as if it is his main message). The Today Programme also tweeted only 30 seconds to single out that brief exchange. Yet, clearly his overall message – in this and other interviews – was that some interventions (e.g. staying at home; self-isolating with symptoms) would have bigger effects than others (e.g. school closures; prohibiting mass gatherings) during the ‘flattening of the peak’ strategy (‘What we don’t want is everybody to end up getting it in a short period of time so that we swamp and overwhelm NHS services’). Rather than describing ‘herd immunity’ as a strategy, he is really describing how to deal with its inevitability.

[PAC: Note that these examples are increasingly difficult to track, because people take the herd immunity argument for granted or cite reference to it misleadingly. For example, Scalley et al state “To widespread criticism, he floated an approach to “build up some degree of herd immunity” founded on an erroneous view that the vast majority of cases would be mild, like influenza”. Their citation takes you here, in which there is no reference to herd immunity or the quotation]

In oral evidence, Vallance (17.3.20: q70) compares these measures as follows (while describing the ‘confidence intervals’ as ‘quite wide’, q77):

‘The interventions we have made have all been modelled out – it is just modelling; we need to be aware of that – to say what effect they would have on the peak. In the first one we introduced, case isolation, you would expect to bring the peak down by about 20%. In the second one, whole household quarantine, you would expect to bring it down by about 25%. The social shielding of the elderly has less of an effect on the peak but a much bigger effect on the mortality, where you might expect it to be between 20% and 30%. General social distancing measures—as you said, quite extreme ones have now been introduced—would be expected to reduce the peak by about 50%. They are not necessarily all completely additive, but it tells you that together we should expect those to have a very significant effect on the peak, and we should start to see the rates come down in two or three weeks’ time. The ambition in any outbreak is to try to get the R0 value down below one. That is the value, on average, of what one person would do in infecting others. At the moment, the R0 value is somewhere between two and three, and the aim is to get it below one, at which time things start to decrease’

Further discussion of herd immunity in oral evidence

Throughout the evidence sessions, some MPs raise the herd immunity idea, but not energetically, and perhaps largely to allow government advisers to clarify their initial statements (e.g. 17.3.20: q112; 17.4.20: q303).

In May, Vallance (5.5.20: q389 and q404) makes it extra-clear that he was not advocating the ‘herd immunity’ idea associated with no intervention:

‘Q389 Chair: It sounds like there is still a degree of uncertainty as to whether an antibody leads to an immune response. Back on 13 March, you said the aim was to build up some kind of herd immunity where lots of people in the country had had the virus so that they could not catch it again. When you said that, which was nearly two months ago, what was your evidence then for the existence of that kind of immunity?

Sir Patrick Vallance: I should be clear about what I was trying to say, and, if I did not say it clearly enough, I apologise. What I was trying to say was that, in the absence of a therapeutic, the way in which you can stop a community becoming susceptible to this is through immunity. Immunity can be obtained either by vaccination or by people who have had the infection. We don’t know, as I said, exactly what degree of protection you get from natural infection, and we don’t yet have a vaccine. The second thing is that the higher the proportion of people in the community with immunity, the easier it is to control the disease and, ultimately, the easier it is to release measures. So vaccination becomes an important part of how you end up with protection, assuming you can get a decent immune response with vaccines, which we also do not know yet, but you would expect there to be some degree of immunity. The expectation is that antibody responses will correlate with immunity to some degree—maybe very high or maybe not so high. As to the degree of protection, whether it is to reduce the severity of the disease or to reduce the overall effect of the disease and the ability to catch the disease, we still have some work to do to find out about that.

Q404 ‘To reiterate, as I said at the beginning to Jeremy Hunt, my points about immunity were not actually about getting immunity through that route. My point has been clear from the outset that we need to suppress the peak, and keep the peak down flat below the level at which the NHS can cope, to protect the NHS and to make sure that we reduce deaths. That has been the strategy.’

Government emails on herd immunity

[Update 15.10.20] The BBC used a Freedom of Information request to secure ‘every email sent by Sir Patrick [Vallance] and chief medical officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, from the start of February to the start of June, containing the words “herd immunity”‘.

The BBC narrative is that some people think that the government was in favour of pursuing ‘herd immunity’ via high infection rates in the population (60%) that would contribute to hundreds of thousands of deaths.

For me, this is a misleading story.

The emails largely show that these advisors regret ever using the term ‘herd immunity’ because it allows people to jump to wild conclusions based on patching together minimal evidence (and ignoring more convincing evidence that advisors pushed strongly for suppression measures).

Dominic Cummings: herd immunity was the plan

(update 24.5.21) On the 22nd May 2021, Dominic Cummings (Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s former Special Advisor) tweeted to confirm that ‘herd immunity’ was government policy before a major policy shift in early March 2020:

As such, I think we are now at the stage of insiders arguing with insiders about (a) what happened, and (b) what ‘herd immunity’ means. It has prompted people to argue that their initial suspicions or reporting has been vindicated (e.g. Robert Peston). It has also prompted rejections of Cummings’ narrative by insiders such as Dr Jenny Harries. At the heart of this discussion is a combination of intentional and unintentional confusion about what ‘herd immunity’ means in relation to policy. For the most energetic government critics, it means an extreme hands-off measure to allow the epidemic to sweep through a population as quickly as possible. For me, it was a phrase used far too loosely to describe aspects of the mitigation strategy in place before lockdown (e.g. cocooning the most vulnerable during a wave of infection). For the government itself, it forms part of the emerging definition described below.

[See also: Who can you trust during the coronavirus crisis? ]

[Update 16.6.21 Cummings also released a lot of information on his substack (7000 words) in relation to his oral evidence (7 hours) to the House of Commons Science and Technology/ Health and Social Care committees]

Defining the COVID-19 problem in the UK

Greater clarity on key terms is essential. It allows us to think more about the implications of the UK government’s problem definition. In a much larger paper (that’s right – its completion is on the to-do list), I suggest that these elements inform the UK government’s definition of the policy problem by mid-March 2020:

We are responding to an epidemic that cannot be eradicated. Herd immunity is only possible if there is a vaccine or enough people are infected and recover. We need to use a suppression strategy to reduce infection enough to avoid overwhelming health service capacity, and shield the people most vulnerable to major illness or death caused by COVID-19, to minimize deaths during at least one peak of infection. We need to maintain suppression for a period of time that is difficult to predict, subject to compliance levels that are difficult to predict and monitor. We need to avoid panicking the public in the lead up to suppression, avoid too-draconian enforcement, and maintain wide public trust in the government. We need to avoid (a) excessive and (b) insufficient suppression measures, either of which could contribute to a second wave of the epidemic of the same magnitude as the first. We need to transition safely from suppression measures to foster economic activity, find safe ways for people to return to work and education, and reinstate the full use of NHS capacity for non-COVID-19 illness. In the absence of a vaccine, this strategy will likely involve social distancing and (voluntary) track-and-trace measures to isolate people with COVID-19. Any action or inaction has a profoundly unequal impact on social groups.

In other words, UK government policy is about reducing or moving the initial peak of infection, followed by longer term management to ensure that the NHS always has capacity to treat. The short-term focus emphasized the need to get the timing right in relation to the balance between public health benefits and social and economic cost (rather than to adopt a precautionary principle):

‘There is also timing. There will be quite a long period between knowing that we have an epidemic running at a reasonable rate and the actual peak. We are keen not to intervene until the point when we absolutely have to, so as to minimise the economic and social disruption on people, and then to stop it again as soon as we can afterwards. It is both the combination of what we need to do—in later questions we might want to go into some details about the things we can do—and the timing. The timing is critical. It is important that we minimise the social disruption while doing what we can to make sure we maximise the public health impact’ (Whitty, 5.3.20: q18)

[See also q39 on the unresolved difficulties of isolating vulnerable people physically without producing too high costs socially, and

q59 on ‘no need at this stage to be stocking up on anything. … this is going to be a marathon not a sprint. This is going to be a long period. There is going to be a lead time before the serious take-off of this comes, which we will be able to indicate … There is nothing in the current environment that would rationally lead someone to want to go out and stock up on stuff’.]

It is difficult to tell exactly what ministers and advisors expect to happen long-term in the absence of a vaccine (although Vallance 17.3.20: q102 is clear that the initial suppression measures will take an indeterminate number of months, not a few weeks). For example, are they managing infections and expecting regular deaths (assuming a mortality rate at approximately 1%) or expecting a high NHS capacity to reduce that mortality rate? Most discussions in public refer generally to the peak and NHS capacity but not the specifics:

‘Overall, the goal is clearly to bend the curve down and to make sure that the NHS capacity is there, and at the same time to do the work to try to improve our ability as a society to cope with this disease, with the goal of lifting some of the incredibly restrictive methods that we have had to place on the population in order to get the disease under control’ (Hancock, 17.4.20: q306)

The long-term implications of ‘flatten the curve’

In that context, Costello (17.4.20: q303) sums up my niggling concerns about the ‘flatten the curve’ message. This phrase suggests that we

keep transmission low enough to make sure that the number of relevant cases does not overwhelm the NHS (an approach with high support), and

accept that transmission will remain at a lower but significant rate until a vaccine is found (an approach that is not discussed as much, but it implies the continuation of deaths at a lower but regular rate):

‘The recent estimates, even from the chief scientific officer, are that after this wave, where we could see 40,000 deaths by the time it is over, we could have maybe only 10% to 15% of the population infected or covered, so the idea of herd immunity would mean maybe another five or six more waves to get to 60%. I do not think we should be using phrases such as “flatten the curve” because it implies continuing. We have to suppress this right down.’ (Costello, 17.4.20: q303)

The other side of this coin is that government advisers were initially working on the assumption that they could keep the initial number of deaths to 20000, which suggests a population infection rate well below 10% of the population (2/60m people, assuming the 1% mortality rate described by Whitty, 5.3.20: q11) and no expectation of herd immunity in the short term.

Comparing the UK definition with approaches in South Korea and China

The oral evidence sessions, probing the UK government’s longer term vision, help make key aspects of this definition somewhat clearer in two main ways.

First, they help confirm that UK policy is built on the assumption that COVID-19 will be a regular or seasonal problem (in the absence of a vaccine and culture change). For example, Hunt (17.3.20: q105) suggests that some country leaders think there will be (a) a peak of infection, then (b) containment, followed by (c) fizzling out:

‘China has officially announced that it thinks it is past the peak. The South Korean Foreign Minister was on TV at the weekend saying that she thinks South Korea has passed the peak, and it seems to think it has passed the peak with less than 1% of the population being infected. It is very realistic that there could be second or third waves, but it does not seem to be expecting it as much as you do … The Chinese and Korean view seems to be that it could be something like SARS, for example, which just burns itself out when the reproduction rate gets below one. Why is it that you are, unfortunately, so certain that it will come back?’

In contrast, Vallance (e.g. 17.3.20: q104-5) suggests strongly that COVID-19’s properties indicate high transmissibility and continuous recurrence (we may have to plan for a ‘spike every year’). This definition of the problem underpins the UK government’s expectation of long term management and, I think, is one of several reasons that ministers and advisers describe evaluation as premature.

Second, they suggest that this approach is built on a further assumption of what it feasible in the UK in relation to social behaviour.

A key element of international comparison relates to very different assumptions about social behaviour in each country. For example, the committee heard from respondents about experiences in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, in which previous pandemics – such as SARS – had a profound effect on government preparation and public behaviour (e.g. Comas-Herrera, 19.5.20: q446; Lum (Professor of Social Work and Social Administration, Hong Kong University) 19.5.20: q450, 456, 463; Chen (Former Vice-President of the Republic of China (Taiwan), 3.6.20: 492-504).

As a result, in many countries, you can expect widespread mask use and routine temperature checks, relatively invasive test and tracing measures, and obligatory isolation, to form part of a government’s response (such as to act quickly on regional ‘hotspots’ to prevent nationwide spread; compare with Hancock, 17.4.20: q318 on the connection of a UK lockdown to national unity, and Vallance, 5.5.20: q410-11 lukewarm on regional approaches, but also Harries, 5.5.20; q416 on the UK addressing hotspots in the earliest phase).

All of these measures and behaviours can contain the transmission of coronavirus in a way that seems to be far less feasible in the UK. For example, Doyle (26.3.20: q199-202) suggests that the South Korean system involves a degree of personal invasion not expected in UK, including giving bank details to government and being tested in public places like restaurants.

Further, even if these measures are possible, there is scepticism about their long-term impact: ‘the Chinese state and people are still doing some pretty extraordinary things’, with the potential that ‘when they take their foot off the brake the epidemic will surge back again’ (Whitty, 5.3.20: q13-4).

Instead, the emphasis from UK government respondents is initially (from March) about recommending the measures with the highest positive public health impact and lowest negative social and economic impact (handwashing). For example, Whitty (5.3.20: q18, see also q25, and Vallance 17.3.20: q92) compares measures:

‘ranging from those with almost no economic impact and high efficacy – top of the range being washing your hands and second being covering your mouth with a tissue when you cough – all the way down to those that have major societal impact, such as closing schools, which obviously affects children but also parents, potentially employment and particular sectors of the economy. It is very easy to choose a package of measures that is quite dramatic but has relatively little impact on the epidemic. We are very keen to avoid that, so we are modelling out all the combinations that we can because people’s livelihoods depend on it’.

Throughout, there is an emphasis on what might work in a UK-style liberal democracy characterised by relatively low social regulation, reinforced with reference to behavioural public policy:

‘All the behavioural science would suggest that we have to get the transparency right. We have to get the communication right. We have to trust that people want to know things, they want to know about this and they want to be able to be empowered to make their own decisions’ (Vallance, 17.3.20: 98).

Against this background, the COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to re- think how we should understand the relationship between public health, ethics and law in the UK and Ireland, informed by a range of academic and public health practitioner perspectives.

Led by Prof Anne-Maree Farrell and Prof Mary Donnelly (Professor of Law at University College Cork, Ireland), this joint ESRC/IRC-funded project will bring together these differing perspectives to gain a better understanding of this relationship and establish a new public health ethics and law research network (PEHL) in the UK and Ireland.

Cardographer Online - Digitising Intelligent Card Based Tools

Led by the University of Nottingham’s Mixed Reality Lab and partnering with the University of Edinburgh and Shanghai Jiaotong University, Dr Lachlan Urquhart is part of a new Universitas 21 project that seeks to digitise intelligent card-based tools. Dr Urquhart will lead on one of the three online user studies strands, based on the Moral-IT card decks he developed, which were created to enable structured reflection on legal, ethical, technical and social implications of new information technologies.

The Covid-19 pandemic has been the impetus for the extension of the project, as the use of such card decks have been part of physical workshops not currently feasible in the current global situation. The ultimate goal will be to develop accessible and agile digital versions of the Cardographer card tools to be distributed and used by participants regardless of where they are in the world.

Justice in Global Health Emergencies and Humanitarian Crises

Global Health Emergencies (GHEs) are crises that affect health, and that are, or should be, of international concern. These might include infectious outbreaks, humanitarian crises and disasters, conflicts, and forced displacements. GHEs are characterised by various forms of urgency and uncertainty, and are known to exacerbate existing inequalities, injustices and vulnerabilities in individuals and communities.



Dr Agomoni Ganguli-Mitra is the PI of a Wellcome Trust Seed Award Project entitled, ‘Vulnerability and justice in global health emergency regulation: developing future ethical models,’ which is currently working on several pieces on the subject of COVID-19.

Legal and Ethical Dimensions of Covid-19 and Providing Professional and Public Guidance

Prof Anne-Maree Farrell and Dr Edward Dove are working in collaboration with Prof John Coggon of the University of Bristol Law School, who has secured funding from the University of Bristol’s Elizabeth Blackwell Institute to track, analyse, and advise on developments in health policy and practice in light of Covid-19. The project is entitled “Covid-19: Explaining the Legal and Ethical Dimensions and Providing Professional and Public Guidance”.

Working with colleagues across the UK’s four nations, and alongside an international advisory group, the project will track and systematise the early run of legislative and policy responses to Covid-19 in health policy and practice contexts; develop explanatory materials and analysis of existing and emerging (including latent) points of law, regulation, and policy (including professional ethical guidance); critically assess the consistency of policy and practice with the UK’s ethical framework for pandemic planning; fundamentally assess the consistency of these materials with basic commitments to the rule of law and human rights; and contribute to processes of reflexive governance for and of health professionals (i.e. through advice on developing policy and practice).

MobilitySafe

Dr Devanjan Bhattacharya is leading an ESRC IAA project, ‘Increasing safety and sustainability of micro-mobility modes in pandemic – MobilitySafe.’ In times of pandemic and conflict public transport and vehicle sharing services are frequently halted or avoided, and many people turn to cycling or walking for small distances. By partnering and working with urban development companies and agencies, such as GIZ India and Deloitte India, alongside local authorities, MobilitySafe aims to provide an open app and web-based utility to help users determine safe walking and cycling routes that avoid transmission spots or conflict zones.

Proposed Protections for Digital Interventions in Relation to Immunity Certificates

Prof Burkhard Schafer is part of a group of academics, who under the editorship of Prof Lilian Edwards (Newcastle University) developed a model ""Coronavirus (Safeguards) Bill 2020: Proposed protections for digital interventions and in relation to immunity certificates."" The proposal was presented to the the Science and Technology Committee, and also referenced approvingly by the UK’s Biometrics Commissioner. The model Bill has by now been translated into Spanish and French, while Prof Schafer is translating and adopting it for a German version.

UK Employment Law and Job Retention

Prof David Cabrelli is undertaking a project on the impact of the UK's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) on UK Employment law. The research will complement existing scholarship which has assessed the effect of the small print of the Direction and also the effect of the CJRS on the statutory employment protection rights of ‘employees’ with a contract of employment. Additionally, it will look further at the effect of the CJRS on ‘workers’, ‘agency workers’, ‘zero-hours contract workers’ and ‘gig economy workers’ who do not necessarily have a contract of employment with their employers and as such, are not ‘employees’, as well as the common law rights of employees and other workers.

Read more about the Direction issued by the Government to HMRC

As part of this work, Prof Cabrelli and Jessica D'alton have published a blog on 'Furlough and Common Law Rights and Remedies' on the UK Labour Law blog, which considers the effect of the UK Government's furlough scheme on the common law rights of employees and workers. Following its publication, its content has been picked up by, and discussed in, the House of Commons Library Briefing Paper 8880.

UK-REACH: Understanding Covid-19 outcomes for ethnic minority healthcare workers

Jointly funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), the University of Leicester-led UK-REACH study (UK Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers) will work with more than 30,000 clinical and non-clinical members of staff to assess their risk of COVID-19, based on the analysis of two million healthcare records.

Led by Dr Manish Pareek, Associate Clinical Professor in Infectious Diseases at the University of Leicester and Honorary Consultant in Infectious Diseases at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, the UK-REACH study will follow a group of healthcare workers from BAME backgrounds for a period of 12 months to see what changes occur in their physical and mental health, how they have changed their professional and social behaviours in response to COVID-19, and how risky their jobs are. The study will also include non-clinical staff integral to the day to day running of healthcare institutions, including cleaners, kitchen staff and porters.

As part of the project, Dr Edward Dove will lead the research strand seeking to understand and address legal, ethical and acceptability issues around data protection, privacy and information governance associated with the linkage of health workers’ registration data and healthcare data.

To mark the occasion, Polygon has produced five new collections, the Edwin Morgan Twenties. Each book contains 20 poems, with an introduction by a well-known writer.

Edward Crossan, Polygon’s poetry editor, takes us behind the scenes.

Where did the idea for the Edwin Morgan 20s come from? Why five books with 20 poems?

With the Edwin Morgan centenary coming up, we wanted to celebrate his work, but also to bring his poetry to a new audience. We wanted to replicate the success of the Muriel Spark Centenary. That was such a good way to present an author’s body of work: repackage the work in a way that makes it aesthetically desirable as well as ‘collectible’. Instead of republishing all of his collections though, we thought it would be a better idea, since he was such an eclectic poet and wrote on various themes, to have five short selections, representing his most popular themes: love, animals, Scotland, places and people, and science fiction. There are twenty poems in each and five collections, so that makes 100 poems in total: 100 poems for 100 years. He was born in the 1920s, so it worked out well to call the collections, with 20 poems, the Edwin Morgan Twenties which we are, of course, celebrating at the start of the twenties.

When did you start working on them?

The initial discussion about the books started in about October 2018, there was a meeting with Michael Schmidt of Carcanet, Hugh Andrew, Hamish Whyte, Robyn Marsack and me. In this meeting it was decided that Polygon would publish the Edwin Morgan Twenties on the centenary and Carcanet would publish a new selected poems, edited by Hamish Whyte, and an updated collected poems, which are to follow later this year and next year, respectively. Hamish Whyte was in charge of selecting the poems to go in each of the five Twenties. The manuscripts and introductions were delivered toward the end of 2019, the page proofs and the cover designs were all signed off by the end that year. The books plus the box sets arrived in the Polygon offices just ahead of lockdown, so I’m pleased to have a set with me on my desk right now.

How did you decide who to approach for the introductions?

We wanted to have writers whose names would draw attention to the work of Edwin Morgan, he is a well known poet in Scotland, but we wanted to attract more attention from across the UK. We wanted to have authors who knew his work well and have been inspired by him. The list of introducers is a good mix of that, not to mention two makars, Liz Lochhead, who was Edwin Morgan’s successor; Morgan being the first of the modern makers, and it was fitting to have Jackie Kay the current makar. We thought Michael Rosen was a perfect choice for Morgan’s animal poems and who better to talk science fiction that Ken MacLeod, and really any excuse to get Ali Smith to interrogate a writer she admires should not be passed up.

How did you decide which poems to pick?

That would be a question for Hamish Whyte. Hamish Whyte was the best person for the task of selecting the poems to go into these books. Whyte is the publisher at Mariscat Press, who published a number of Morgan’s collections.







We love the design – how did that come about?

The format of the books was inspired by the old Penguin classics, they are small and can easily fit in the pocket, poetry that can be taken with you where ever you go. The design was inspired by the aesthetic of the man himself. The brief was written with Morgan’s own natty dress sense in mind, he was known for his style, maybe not the best dressed, but definitely stood out from the rest. And so it was with this in mind that we wanted these books to really stand out: bold colours, with a pattern that can be replicated across five books and a box set.

The designer Teresa Monachino, did a great job of taking the brief and bringing it to life. She took his initials, EM, and created a very eye-catching, slightly seventies pattern that is used to great effect across five very colourful, eye-catching designs. The Edwin Morgan Twenties logo was inspired by part of the brief for the books, in which we wanted to use his iconic eye-wear, Morgan was always pictured with his square framed glasses and so Teresa took that idea and created the EM Twenties logo.

Do you have a favourite of the five books?

It is really difficult to choose. There is so much to take from all of his books. I’m not a reader of science fiction, but I love ‘The First Men on Mercury’, and the creativity, humanity and humour in ‘The Computer’s First Christmas Card’ found in Space and Spaces.

And to read the work of a writer that was so in love with and connected so profoundly to his country and to his city, Glasgow, the poems in Scotland sweep across the land and poke a bit of fun at the country, but at the same time take pride in its history.

But I think it has to be his love poems that I find the most engaging, that ever perplexing word ‘Love’ because after all ‘Love is the most mysterious of the winds that blow’. A lot of these poems were written at a time when homosexuality was illegal ‘yet I can’t not be what I am’, there is such a tenderness to these, a poignancy, a longing that can’t be reciprocated. Look at his poem ‘A Divide’ in which he describes an ‘almost’ happiness during an evening spent with a man who ‘can’t be what I’m not’ and to whom Morgan cannot reveal how he feels:

How hard it is not to watch you. We had got to that stage of not talking and not worrying, and that was almost happy. Then, late when you lay on one elbow on the carpet I could feel nothing but that hot knife of pain telling me what it was, and I can’t tell you about it, not one word. “A Divide”

Although divided into five different themes, it’s the humour and the humanity that is the glue and the thing that makes Edwin Morgan’s work so accessible and so relevant and at a time like this his work has never been more relevant:

Morgan, I said to myself, take note, Take Heart. In a time of confusion You must make a stand.

The Edwin Morgan Twenties are now available on our website, with free postage for delivery direct to your door."

The Edwin Morgan Trust said it is reimagining and expanding on the physical programme celebrating the former Scots makar’s work as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Morgan was born in the west end of Glasgow on April 27, 1920 and died aged 90 in August 2010.

As part of the celebrations, a new online video channel – Hold Hands Among the Atoms – will launch on Monday, April 27 on what would have been the poet’s 100th birthday.

It will feature elements originally planned for the public programme of #EdwinMorgan100, alongside new material created especially for the online channel.

It aims to bring together diverse voices and perspectives from across the globe to celebrate the poet’s work and life.

It will launch with a short film, Open the Doors!, featuring contributions from Morgan’s friends, collaborators and celebrity fans including current makar Jackie Kay, former makar Liz Lochhead, ex-UK poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy, actors Alan Cumming and Kate Dickie, and singer Eddi Reader.

Edwin Morgan Trust: He published 25 collections of poetry.

The trust has also announced an artist grant scheme, supported by Creative Scotland and the Saltire Society, which will provide funding for creative people working in a variety of art forms to respond to Morgan’s work.

Robyn Marsack, a friend of Morgan’s and the trustee leading the centenary celebrations, said: “When Edwin turned 80, he wrote a poem about pushing the boat out into the unknown – unknown is best, he declared.

“I can’t guess what he would have thought about the pandemic but I can be sure that his restless, dauntless imagination would have engaged with it.”

She added: “What a great example of inquiring creativity, of energy, humour and belief in human capacity he remains to us and how important it is to be reminded of an imagination and linguistic vitality that soars from his beloved Glasgow to Saturn and back.

“We wanted to encourage artists to respond to his work in a virtual space while social distancing is in place, to reach audiences through all the various media at their disposal in the way that Edwin, with his wide interests and curiosity, would have wished.

“The trust is delighted that Creative Scotland and the Saltire Society are enabling us to offer these opportunities to artists at a time when ‘unknown’ feels frightening – we hope we can all take courage from Edwin’s words.”

A new video will be released on the 27th of every month from April to December this year on Hold Hands Among the Atoms, the title of which is taken from the cycle of 70 social poems Morgan wrote for his 70th birthday – the year he announced publicly that he was gay.

Readers from around the world are being invited to share their favourite Morgan poems on social media on April 27 across video, text or any other medium they find appropriate, using the hashtags #edwinmorgan100 and #holdhandsamongtheatoms.

Morgan was recognised as one of the great poets of the 20th century and was appointed Scots makar, in effect Scotland’s poet laureate, in 2004 by then-first minister Jack McConnell.

During his life he published 25 collections of poetry, translated hundreds of poems and wrote plays.

Readers from around the world are being invited to share their favourite Morgan poems on social media on Monday April 27 across video, text or any other medium they find appropriate, using the hashtags #edwinmorgan100 and #holdhandsamongtheatoms.

Morgan was recognised as one of the great poets of the 20th century and was appointed Scots makar, in effect Scotland’s poet laureate, in 2004 by then-first minister Jack McConnell.

During his life he published 25 collections of poetry, translated hundreds of poems and wrote plays.

A two-day conference to be held at Glasgow University has been cancelled but some of the other planned projects are going ahead, such as Hold Hands Among The Atoms, a video channel to be hosted online, and The Second Life, an artists’ grant scheme and a nod to the title of one of his most celebrated collections. Hold Hands Among The Atoms goes live on Monday with a video titled Open The Doors!, the title taken from the poem Morgan wrote to celebrate the opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999. A new film exploring aspects of Morgan’s work and legacy will be posted on the 27th of each month.

In the more traditional world of paper and print, Edinburgh-based publisher Birlinn has produced The Edwin Morgan Twenties, a five-book boxset collection divided into five categories – Love, Scotland, Take Heart, Space And Spaces and Menagerie – with each book containing 20 poems. Meanwhile Glasgow-based indie publisher Speculative Books is putting out a collection of poetry drawn from an open submission and inspired by Morgan’s celebrated scrapbooks, described by them as “visually arresting, playful, dynamic … a queer visual diary, a catalogue of images, and a surreal bricolage”. They’re currently held in Glasgow University Library.

Come Monday itself the hashtag #edwinmorgan100 will be trending in Scotland as readers post their favourite poems on social media, and the event organisers have commissioned a series of digital birthday cards which can be downloaded and posted online. And, of course, many will also find the time to raise a glass or two in celebration.

Among them will be Morgan’s close friend Jackie Kay, a poet and author and the woman who currently holds the position of Makar, having assumed it from Liz Lochhead in 2016.

“I think I’ll mark it quietly myself with a wee malt in my own wee quaich, and I’ll toast him with a Talisker,” she tells me. “He wasn’t a great drinker but he’ll appreciate the toast. You always thought that he would live until 100 but in a way he has because we’ll all be thinking of him and celebrating him.”

Like many Scots, Kay first encountered the work of Edwin Morgan as a teenager, in her case at high school in Bishopbriggs in Glasgow.

“It was interesting because he was one of the few contemporary poets we studied and looked at,” she says. “I didn’t know he was gay then because he wasn’t out as a gay man, but I remember the ambiguity of the love poems because there wasn’t a direct person being addressed. I sensed from the poems that there were things not being said in his love poems that were said in others, so I was curious about that even at that age and found it interesting.”

Kay was 17 when she first heard Morgan read, at the Highland Institute in Sauchiehall Street. “He was an amazing reader of his work. He was quite diffident and shy in person but then he’d get on stage and he was absolutely hilarious. He’d have people crying with laughter, so that was really amazing. A bit after that I got to read with him myself, which was even better. I remember doing a reading with him in Cardiff when I was about 27, before I was published. There was me, Edwin Morgan, Sorley MacLean and Norman MacCaig. It felt like an extraordinary experience.” She still has a photograph of the event.

Kay subsequently became friendly with Morgan. She visited him in the care home he moved to until his death aged 90 in 2010, and exchanged letters with him. Friendly as they were, however, it was difficult to become close to him. Kay remembers a man who could be guarded and secretive.

“I think he got into the way of being secretive after years and years of being in the closet,” she says. “I remember making a radio programme with him once called Word On the Street and I asked him about whether he missed the secrecy that being gay involved and to my surprise he said he did, because there was a great power to a secret. There was just the two of you that shared it.”

Born in Glasgow in 1920 and raised in Rutherglen, Morgan grew up an only child in a wealthy family. His father, Stanley, was the director of a company of iron and steel merchants. Morgan attended Rutherglen Academy (notable former pupils include Midge Ure and Stan Laurel) and in 1937 enrolled at Glasgow University. Called up in 1940, he registered as a conscientious objector (to the great dismay of his parents) but spent the war with the Royal Army Medical Corps in the Middle East.

After returning to his studies in 1947 and graduating from Glasgow University in English Language and Literature he took a lecturing job in the English department. And there he stayed until retirement in 1980.

Morgan published his first poetry collection in 1952 but it was the arrival of The Second Life in 1968 that announced him as a major voice in Scottish poetry. By then he had encountered and been influenced by the American Beat poets, particularly Allen Ginsberg and William Carlos Williams, and written some of the poems which remain among his most popular. That list includes The Death Of Marilyn Monroe and King Billy, about the demise and funeral of Billy Fullerton, leader of notorious Glasgow razor gang the Billy Boys.

Like Jackie Kay, the actress Elaine C Smith first encountered Morgan’s work at school, and those two poems in particular have stayed with her.

Con man, charlatan, rebel, visionary. Who was the real Malcolm McLaren?

“I remember being struck by how much it resonated culturally with me,” she says. “We’d been reading Burns before and that didn’t so much reflect where I lived and where I came from. King Billy certainly did that.” Later, when she was trying for drama school, Smith used Morgan’s The Death Of Marilyn Monroe as her audition piece and their paths crossed in person many times over the following years. “I don’t mean that we were great friends or anything like that, but I shared many a political platform with him. He was there at the inaugural meeting of artists for an independent Scotland, and as ever had great things to say – incisive, funny, and a man full of humility as well.”

For fellow actress Kate Dickie and for author and broadcaster Damien Barr, presenter of BBC Scotland’s The Big Scottish Book Club, it was a similar story.

“Edwin's poetry had a massive impact on my life,” says Dickie. “I discovered him when I was 15 in English class at school. I’d never read any contemporary poetry and I didn’t know that poems could be like stories and modern and touch me and that I could relate to and that I could get. I was blown away.”

Barr, growing up gay in a small village in Lanarkshire, had no idea that the poems he was reading celebrated the love between two men or even that their author was still alive. “I thought all poets had to be dead, but Edwin Morgan was very much still alive and very much still writing about the country that he helped shape with his words. And what an incredible thing for a poet to shape a nation – Edwin Morgan shaped our nation with his words just as surely as politicians shape it with their laws.”

As well as finding his poetic voice by the early-1960s Morgan had also found love: with John Scott, a storeman in a factory. They remained partners until Scott’s death in 1978. Meeting Scott, Morgan said in 1990, “was probably the thing that unleashed most of the poems in the 1960s … Most of them, not every one exactly, but most of them did come out of things that actually happened.” One example is Strawberries, still one of Morgan’s most popular poems. It wasn’t until 1990, however, that Morgan came out publicly as gay. Until then, his view of his own sexuality was that it was personal. What eventually changed his mind was politics.

“I think he would have felt, like a lot of people, that it wasn’t really anybody’s business,” says Kay. “But it was also a generational thing. It wasn’t that long ago from his point of view that it was illegal and as a gay man you developed a whole way of being to try to avoid being arrested. I think these habits run deep and are hard to shake off even when you’re able to. So it was partly society’s fault and partly his own reticence, being quite a private person and thinking that he didn’t need to share it until Clause 28 made him think he absolutely had to.”

A particularly spiteful and pernicious element of the 1988 Local Government Act brought in by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, Clause 28 stipulated that local authorities “shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality” or “promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship”.

Local hero: how Gerry Cinnamon took on the music industry and won

Morgan was 70 when he came out in 1990. By then he had published widely and in a dazzling array of formats, from sonnets to concrete poetry, and throughout the 1990s and in the years that followed the opening of the Scottish Parliament he found younger collaborators in other fields of artistic endeavour, particularly music. The jazz musician Tommy Smith set a series of Morgan poems about the history of the earth to music in 1997, calling the project Planet Wave. A mixture of music, poetry, electronica, samples and performance it has become a significant part of the repertoire of Smith’s National Jazz Orchestras of Scotland and was performed by it as recently as February. Meanwhile Morgan collaborated with the rock band Idlewild on their 2002 album The Remote Part and five years later two of his poems were used on The Ballad Of The Book, an collaborative album between Scottish musicians and Scottish poets curated by Idlewild frontman Roddy Woomble.

As well as poetry Morgan also translated the work of others, beginning with a 1952 translation of Beowulf which is still in use today, and when he won the prestigious Soros Translation Award in 1985 he blew the prize money on a trip to Lapland on Concorde. That was the closest he ever came to space, though things stellar, cosmic and interplanetary were an abiding interest and influence. He was one of the first private citizens to put his name down for a putative space flight and his 1973 collection From Glasgow To Saturn contains such cock-eyed gems as The First Men On Mercury.

“There were certain themes he returned to again and again,” says Jackie Kay. “He wrote a lot about love, about Scotland, about changes in our society, changes in technology. He wrote a lot about life on other planets and about owning and claiming landscape … but I think the thing about him is that he can’t really be boxed into categories and that’s what’s refreshing about him.”

So as well as looking backwards and celebrating a life and the work it produced, the Edwin Morgan centenary programme is about asking Scots to look forward, as Morgan himself did, tirelessly and relentlessly.

“I think his lasting legacy is that he broke doors open,” says Jackie Kay. For her, Morgan was in the very vanguard of 20th century Scottish writers, a true pioneer, and it’s that which we should remember on Monday and for the months ahead.

“He was interested in absolutely everything. He had an encyclopaedic knowledge and his mind was amazing. There was nothing that couldn’t be included in a poem – anything that interested him, he could find a way to write about it. That’s interesting as a writer because a lot of poets aren’t necessarily like that. They might find things interesting but not be able to write about them or find a poem in them. But Eddy could find poems in the most surprising places. In that way he burst down the stable doors and let out all these horses. He has allowed people a great deal of freedom.”

And as the man himself might have said, freedom rules OK.

They had lain in a drawer for decades, sketches of the poet as a young man, the first lines drawn in the creation of one of the most famous pieces of modern Scottish art.

When artist Sandy Moffat discovered some old notepads while clearing out a drawer, he’d no idea how significant the sketches inside would prove to be.

Now, to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Edwin Morgan, the country’s first National Poet, Moffat is sharing the ­remarkable rediscovered working sketches made as part of a historic commission for the then Scottish Arts Council in the late-1970s.

And, 40 years after their creation, the early pieces have inspired the man who made them to revisit them for a present-day reinterpretation.

The outlines from Morgan’s series of sittings with Moffat, seen for the first time in today’s Sunday Post, come to light with the launch of a programme by the Edwin Morgan Trust marking what would have been the Makar’s 100th birthday tomorrow.

The works afforded Moffat, one of the country’s most revered painters, who taught at Glasgow School of Art, a nostalgic reverie back to the works he composed in the late-1970s and early-1980s.

He said: “Old sketchbooks pile up and you forget about them, then 20 years later you don’t have a clue what’s in them so you rake around and you find these things. It gives you quite a shock, but it’s good to have them.

“I must have used several different sketchbooks. There’s one I found that had drawings of Iain Crighton Smith, Hugh MacDiarmid and very detailed studies of Robert Garrioch. Edwin was in that too.”

Moffat’s portrait of Morgan hangs in the National Galleries of Scotland, alongside Poets Pub, his famous imagined coming together of modern literary titans.

The work was part of a commission which saw the artist paint eminent Scottish writers and came from a series of meetings between the men at Glasgow University, where Morgan taught, his flat on Great Western Road, and Moffat’s studio at Glasgow School of Art in the late-1970s.

Of his find, Moffat said: “Drawings like these are like notes. You start off looking around, seeing things on his desk, pens, paper, making a rough note of the things that are there.

“In the final painting, you can see the outline of the Hunterian Gallery at Glasgow University, there’s a nod to Paolozzi, a Bauhaus chair and things that add up to Morgan’s interest in contemporary forms of poetry and art, things I could use to say this is his view of Scotland.

“And he was a great translator. He translated Russian, Hungiarian, German and so on.

“We had access to a fantastic world view from these guys, so you could only ever benefit from sitting listening to him.

“He also experimented with different forms of poetry, like concrete poetry, visual arrangements of words and sentences, and it was good to talk to him about things like that, He was a great fan of the painter Joan Eardley, and that dialogue between the arts has always interested me – poets, painters, film makers, theatre people, musicians, how we can share things and work together.

“I wanted to paint modern Scotland, as it were, or a vision of Scotland that was an important place going somewhere, that had an important history. That’s what the poets talked about in their work, as well.”

Moffat recalled how Morgan was “the perfect subject”.

He said: “He didn’t fidget or muck about. Some people fuss about, they look in the mirror. He was just fine. He wore a very nice jacket, light and colourful, and I told him to keep wearing that, that it was the jacket I wanted to paint him in. That was a way in for me, because you’re always looking for a hook. It got me off to a good start.

“Obviously one of the treats meeting the poets was listening to what they had to say about things. I used to take longer on the drawings so I could have another session just so I could listen to what they had to talk about. There was no point in rushing.”

It was while studying Edinburgh College of Art that Moffat first encountered Morgan, who died aged 90, 10 years ago in Glasgow, at a poetry reading in the capital in the 1960s with Hugh MacDiarmid and Norman MacCaig.

The artist recalled: “It was pretty euphoric. One of the poems he read then was The Death Of Marilyn Monroe. That was a real eye opener – a guy in Scotland writing about Marilyn Monroe in such a different way. It seemed to me then that we in Scotland could do these things. That felt important. Those readings really seeped in to what I was working on and thinking about.”

One other sketch from the sittings came to light 15 years ago when a former colleague of Moffat’s came across it while clearing out a drawer. It now resides at Glasgow University’s Scottish Literature Department.

While Moffat has no plans to exhibit the discovery of forgotten artistic treasures, their discovery – and the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions – have given the artist the impetus to revisit his old subjects.

“We have time on our hands, so I’m maybe going to poke my nose into some of these old sketchbooks because I had a lot of sketches that didn’t go into the big painting,” he said.

“So I’ve been thinking about using the time to go back and see if I can make something of the initial idea, do it a completely different way. There’s more to be said, so why not have a go.”

And, having spent time capturing Morgan’s essence in what has come to represent both men’s legacy, the painter is well-placed to consider what the poet might think of Scotland today.

He said: “I think Edwin’s position now would be much the same as it was when he died. What was it he said in poem he wrote for the opening of the Scottish Parliament? That we’d made a start but that we needed to be more courageous, more ambitious, not be cautious.”

Moffat last met the Makar shortly before his death.

“He’d gown a muckle big beard and we had a laugh about it,” he said. “I said I should come back and do a new painting. But he was 90-odd and, though it would have been good to go back, he was very frail, and it might have been an imposition.

“It meant a great deal that I was able to paint the poets in the first place. Some of them weren’t that well known at the time, a lot of people had no idea what they looked like, so I feel like I contributed in some small way towards them becoming household names.

“Sometimes artists throw things out and they don’t know what they’ve thrown out. I’ve made some mistakes with that in the past. But I’m glad I held onto this one way or another, even at the bottom of the pile.”

The centenary celebration of one of Scotland’s greatest poets, Edwin Morgan, is being reimagined and expanded for online as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Edwin Morgan Trust said that plans are being put in place to commemorate the former Scots makar’s work in the absence of physical events.

Morgan was born in the west end of Glasgow on April 27 1920 and died aged 90 in August 2010.

As part of the celebrations, a new online video channel – Hold Hands Among the Atoms – will launch on Monday April 27 on what would have been the poet’s 100th birthday.

It will feature elements originally planned for the public programme of #EdwinMorgan100, alongside new material created especially for the online channel.

It aims to bring together diverse voices and perspectives from across the globe to celebrate the poet’s work and life.

It will launch with a short film, Open the Doors!, featuring contributions from Morgan’s friends, collaborators and celebrity fans including current makar Jackie Kay, former makar Liz Lochhead, ex-UK poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy, actors Alan Cumming and Kate Dickie, and singer Eddi Reader.

The trust has also announced an artist grant scheme, supported by Creative Scotland and the Saltire Society, which will provide funding for creative people working in a variety of art forms to respond to Morgan’s work.

Robyn Marsack, a friend of Morgan’s and the trustee leading the centenary celebrations, said: “When Edwin turned 80, he wrote a poem about pushing the boat out into the unknown – unknown is best, he declared.

“I can’t guess what he would have thought about the pandemic but I can be sure that his restless, dauntless imagination would have engaged with it.”

She added: “What a great example of inquiring creativity, of energy, humour and belief in human capacity he remains to us and how important it is to be reminded of an imagination and linguistic vitality that soars from his beloved Glasgow to Saturn and back.

“We wanted to encourage artists to respond to his work in a virtual space while social distancing is in place, to reach audiences through all the various media at their disposal in the way that Edwin, with his wide interests and curiosity, would have wished.

“The trust is delighted that Creative Scotland and the Saltire Society are enabling us to offer these opportunities to artists at a time when ‘unknown’ feels frightening – we hope we can all take courage from Edwin’s words.”

A new video will be released on the 27th of every month from April to December this year on Hold Hands Among the Atoms, the title of which is taken from the cycle of 70 social poems Morgan wrote for his 70th birthday – the year he announced publicly that he was gay.

Readers from around the world are being invited to share their favourite Morgan poems on social media on Monday April 27 across video, text or any other medium they find appropriate, using the hashtags #edwinmorgan100 and #holdhandsamongtheatoms.

Edwin Morgan always seemed like a man who might make 100.

He had a boyish curiosity and fascination for everything. His series of Glasgow Sonnets are among my favourite of his poems.

He writes about the city so well and many of his poems like From A City Balcony capture that view.

Morgan saw Glasgow. A city with a great big heart; a city of opposites.

Morgan’s poems are often witty, sardonic, hilarious. In this poem you feel his rage, his anger that poverty like this should exist.

The last line “into an air too poor to rob” still packs a powerful punch.

© PA

A mean wind wanders through the backcourt trash.

Hackles on puddles rise, old mattresses

puff briefly and subside. Play-fortresses

of brick and bric-a-brac spill out some ash.

Four storeys have no windows left to smash,

but in the fifth a chipped sill buttresses

mother and daughter the last mistresses

of that black block condemned to stand, not crash.

Around them the cracks deepen, the rats crawl.

The kettle whimpers on a crazy hob.

Roses of mould grow from ceiling to wall.

The man lies late since he has lost his job,

smokes on one elbow, letting his coughs fall

thinly into an air too poor to rob."

Edwin Morgan (1920-2010) considered his 100-poem sequence, The New Divan, his war poem.

A conscientious objector, Morgan served in a non-combatant role in the Royal Army Medical Corps in north Africa during the second world war. He wrote the sequence years after the experience, and published it in 1977, by which time his major collections, The Second Life (1968) and From Glasgow to Saturn (1973) had established his reputation. He chose the right moment for himself as a poet: it’s as if the poem had always been waiting for him to find his “hail voice”.

The sequence is non-linear. There are narrative glimpses only. Many of the poems have a swift, strange jostle of images, like vivid dreams, almost surreal. War’s violence is more often hinted than described, part of the symbolism of red, a favourite colour in the swirling weave. Blood, roses, sunset, fire, wine, the eyes after drinking – all shades and moods of red connect Morgan’s” divan” (the word means in Persian a collection of poems) to the original Divan by the 14th-century Sufi poet Hafiz.

Love, for Morgan as for Hafiz, is the major theme. In a context where homosexual relationships were officially forbidden, it’s a charged and complex business. As the second poem here affirms, to be in love was “against King’s Regulations.” It would not have been an easy subject for Morgan at the time of writing, either.

Sufi mysticism and carnal ecstasy merge for both poets. Of course, Morgan’s persona isn’t seeking union with God, but the ecstatic union with the man he desires, Cosgrove, is a spiritual matter in that it’s a quest for the utmost personal authenticity. The shapes, colours and syntax of Morgan’s poems, so unlike Hafiz’s stately ghazals, make them seem to dance like whirling dervishes, the Sufi worshippers who seek divine connection through bodily movement. As the Indian mystic, Acharya Rajneesh, (Osho), explained, “Sufis sing, they don’t give sermons, because life is more like a song and less like a sermon. And they dance, and they don’t talk about dogmas, because a dance is more alive, more like existence, more like the birds singing in the trees ... The whole life is a dance, vibrating, throbbing, with infinite life. Sufis like to dance; they are not interested in dogmas.”

In Poem 1, Morgan addresses the “old nightingale” Hafiz himself, and refers to the text where Hafiz declares: “Open my grave when I am dead, and thou shalt see a cloud of smoke rising out from it; then shalt thou know that the fire still burns in my dead heart; yea, it has set my very winding-sheet alight.” (Gertrude Bell’s translation). Death in Morgan’s poem is retrospective transformation: “But / not the song the Sufi says we have / but our dying song, you knew, gives us our beings.” It seems likely that Morgan wrote the Divan after Cosgrove’s death; it was certainly written when the realisation of that love was no longer a possibility. But the love gives Morgan his song.

No 82 is a long way “ahead” in the sequence – or would be if The New Divan were chronologically structured. This poem has a lighter, airier voice: insouciant as well as sad, it captures the character of Cosgrove, and the obligatory playfulness which both defuses and heightens the relationship. Gallus (line 10) is an adjective in Scots . The fact that Gallus is a proper noun in Latin creates an ambiguity: might it also be read as a reference to the Roman prefect-in-Egypt, Aelius Gallus, whose expedition was described by Strabo, among others?

No 92 laments the disunity jarring the heart of Morgan’s wartime experience. Angels are imperfect, or invisible. Capital letters shout, Beware Landmines. An excursion into concrete poetry results in a mechanical, anti-creation hymn . Mass, mess, miss, moss, muss: the hissing litany of words chancily formed by the sequence of vowels, recalls a device used humorously in The Computer’s First Christmas Card. Poem 92 is a cry of pain, but still a word-dance.

Edwin Morgan’s 100th birthday would have been on 27 April. I’m delighted to have an excuse to return to his work, and for PotW to play a small part in his centenary celebrations. No 20th-century poetry has brought me more varied, intense and unfading pleasure than Morgan’s. His is the song of our time – the living, not the dying, song which “gives us our being”."

I am the Project Officer for a new project exploring EU and UK copyright policy. This is a joint endeavour between Special Collections and CREATe (the RCUK Centre for Copyright and New Business Models in the Creative Economy, based at the University of Glasgow). Copyright law and our understanding of it remains a significant barrier to digitisation of archive materials. Recent changes in the law (IPO Guidelines) will be tested with a rights clearance exercise focussing on the Scrapbooks created by the poet Edwin Morgan (1920-2010).

Amongst Morgan’s extensive archive in Special Collections, are sixteen scrapbooks which he sought to have published in 1953 and in the late 1980s but the high costs of printing and copyright clearance made it too difficult. He was meticulous in his organisation of the books, with each page numbered and the sources of many newspaper and magazine cuttings noted. However most of the vast number of images are uncredited, making the scrapbooks particularly appropriate to use in a project of this kind.

Dating from 1931 to 1966, the scrapbooks number around 3,600 pages across volumes ranging from modestly-sized ledgers to gargantuan tomes. Morgan began compiling the books as a schoolboy, later describing them as “partly documentary/historical, partly aesthetic, partly satirical and partly personal…a Whitmanian reflecting glass of ‘the world.’” (See a selection of images on Flickr with commentary by Morgan’s biographer James McGonigal). He placed a great value on them, and they were among the first items from his archive to enter the collection at the University of Glasgow, in December 1980.

Taking material from a wide range of sources, the scrapbooks show his interest in science, nature, art and literature. Their format reflects the part-work encyclopaedias he loved as a child, where a vast range of subjects were presented together in a weekly magazine. Although he did some travelling in Europe and Russia as well as serving in the Middle East in World War II, Morgan lived in Glasgow throughout his life. The scrapbooks were thus a way to explore the world, with an equal interest in stories from Glasgow as international news. Most of the material has been cut from newspapers, magazines and books; he confessed to being ruthless in cutting up source material.

For Morgan, the scrapbooks were significant on a number of levels. They record personal experiences, including tickets, photographs and paper ephemera from places visited and events attended. His own photography is included, with self-portraits, images of friends and family plus holiday snapshots, scenes of Glasgow and photos taken during his military service.

Some instances of original content by Morgan can be found in the books. He includes handwritten notes recording experiences such as an overheard conversation on the bus, a description of a particularly vivid dream or a note of a striking coincidence. Throughout the volumes his interest in strange phenomena is evident. Some of the cuttings come from Doubt, the magazine of the Fortean Society, and local newspaper stories about sightings of UFOs or the Loch Ness monster appear in many volumes. Science fiction had been an interest of Morgan since childhood and also became a theme in his poetry. Scientific developments are well recorded, from the exciting stores of satellite launches to the terrifying consequences of nuclear bombs at Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

The earlier scrapbooks contain some examples of Morgan’s artwork in the form of vividly painted designs and pencil sketches. He had considered applying to Glasgow School of Art before deciding to study English at The University of Glasgow. The scrapbooks remained a vitally important creative outlet during the time he was establishing himself as a writer, until his early forties. Many of the pages have been collaged in striking and humorous ways with words and images. While they do not contain drafts of his poetry, the scrapbooks are undoubtedly linked to his writing. He includes poetry he admires, but it is his delight in the word play of newspaper headlines and the creation of humorous text collages that anticipate his own concrete poetry. His series of Newspoems (contained within his Collected Poems), which engage with newspaper headlines, can also be related to the cuttings he collected.

On a personal level, the scrapbooks show the poet’s search for identity and exploration of the different sides of his personality. As a gay man, Morgan has spoken of “the sheer difficulty, particularly at the time when I grew up, of even thinking far less writing openly about these things.” (see Nothing Not Giving Messages). Although he did not talk openly about his sexuality until the 1980s, there were veiled references in his poetry, as in the scrapbooks too. The cuttings he selected include many images of men – anonymous kilted men, contemporary stars like Cliff Richard, and body builders from physique magazines.

Aspects of the scrapbooks will be explored in further blog posts throughout the course of the project. Previous posts about the Edwin Morgan Archive can be found here.

Coronavirus and cerebral palsy

Having cerebral palsy does not necessarily put someone at higher risk of getting infected with coronavirus. However, if you have an associated condition or have a weakened immune system, it may affect your ability to deal with the virus if you were to get it. The Association of British Neurologists have published guidance on Covid-19 for people with neurological conditions, their doctors and carers.

Advice for people who were on the Highest Risk list

On 31 May 2022, the Scottish Government ended the Covid-19 Highest Risk List and associated guidance for people that were categorised as being at highest risk of coronavirus. The Scottish Government’s current advice for people who were on this list is:

To keep up to date with your Covid-19 vaccinations

If you have a weakened immune system, to adhere to the Scottish Government guidance for immunosuppressed people

Booster vaccination programme

Vaccines continue to be offered at certain times for some people, including:

children and adults with a chronic neurological condition, including cerebral palsy, which may put them at higher clinical risk from coronavirus

carers

people who are household contacts of people with a weakened immune system.

You can find out if you are eligible for a booster by visiting NHS Inform. If you feel that you are eligible, but have not received an invitation letter, then you can self-book via the online portal or by calling the national vaccination helpline on 0800 030 8013.

Scottish Government advice

All covid rules and restrictions have been lifted in Scotland, but the virus has not gone away.

The Scottish Government recommends that everyone uses ‘Covid sense’ to help protect yourself and others:

get your vaccine when offered to ensure you are fully protected

open windows when socialising indoors

wear a face covering in indoor public places and on public transport

wash your hands to protect yourself

take a PCR test and isolate if you have symptoms

take an LFD test before visiting someone in a hospital or care home

Care for yourself and others to help slow down the spread of the virus and reduce pressure on our health services.

UKRI ‘Coronavirus and people with learning disabilities’ study’

The UKRI ‘Coronavirus and people with learning disabilities’ study was a year long project involving researchers and organisations across the UK to find out and report on how coronavirus affected, and is still affecting the lives of people with a learning disability, as well as their parents and carers.

SCLD was pleased to be a partner organisation in Scotland along with PAMIS and the University of Glasgow. SCLD helped to recruit participants for the study and convened an advisory group of people with learning disabilities, who helped to shape the questions. This group named themselves, the ‘COV Explorers’.

In September 2021, the findings from the last wave of the study were published.

The findings show that people with learning disabilities have done their bit through the pandemic to keep themselves and others safe: over 90% are double vaccinated; most are still wearing masks in public and getting regular COVID tests. However, more than half are worried about leaving the house, more than 1 in 5 are often or always anxious, or have had a new or worsening health problem.

As your child will be using a device on a home network for longer than usual, it may be worth checking that you have appropriate parental controls to filter and monitor internet use. The way that you set this up is dependent on the device and your internet provider. There are details on this site to help, and O2 have a free helpline in association with the NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) which you can call for help setting this up.

Concerns about Home Internet Connection

We are aware than not everybody has a strong internet connection. All our documentation and training for teachers stresses that there may be many difficulties for families and if we do have to close, they will have to bear this in mind. We have made it clear that all work should be posted by email (Preschool), on Edmodo (KG - Grade 2) or Google Classroom (Grade 3 and above), and should be able to be completed without video input from teacher. Hopefully a lot of the tasks can be completed offline.

It felt as if the decks had been cleared. There are almost 4,000 patients at my practice on the south side of the city, close to the university. As the lockdown began, my colleagues and I were spending our time phoning two or three hundred of the frailest, as well as the 30 or so who had been advised by the government to “shield” from the virus until July at least. On the phone we made sure they understood the advice to stay in and that they had arranged food deliveries for the coming weeks. We checked they had a “key information summary” – an electronic précis of their principal medical issues – available for paramedics, A&E and hospital staff to access should they become unwell.

In the first few weeks of the year, the pandemic had been a dreaded but distant anxiety. I had little sense of how severely it would hit us, and how much planning would be enough. The speed of its arrival was startling, and the past six or seven weeks have been unlike anything I’ve known in general practice.

Everything about the way we work has been transformed. The number of face-to-face encounters with patients has dropped by 90%. Home visiting is both more time-consuming (because of the requirement for personal protective equipment, or PPE), and perfunctory (to cut contact time). Dread has given way to fatigue, but not to complacency. I’m worried that too few people are being tested, that the test itself is often inaccurate and that our PPE provision is inadequate. The health gap between rich and poor, already wide from a decade of cuts to councils and benefits, is being stretched wider.

Now that restrictive lockdown measures are starting to be eased, cases will surely climb. My GP colleagues and I have all seen some patients with Covid-19, but because of the effectiveness of the lockdown, fewer than forecast in those dark days of March. Two of our patients have died of it – about the same proportion, 1 in 2,000, as have so far died of the virus nationwide.

The agility of the NHS in response to the crisis has been impressive. Our practice has four GPs and two nurses; all still travel to and from the clinic every day, and the four receptionists are still fielding and triaging calls. The appointments book is filled as usual, but now with names for the clinicians to phone back, rather than with appointment times for patients to come in.

The NHS is notorious for its slow uptake of technology – I still use fax machines and pagers daily – but we can now text patients’ phones with a link to open a video call to our aged desktop PCs. There are still clinical problems for which a physical examination is imperative: those I do at the practice if the patient is fit enough to come in, or at their home if they’re not.

Either way, I wear a mask, apron and visor, and two pairs of gloves. As aspiring GPs we were taught to value the subtleties of human communication – to carefully attend to body language, to silences, to the way a patient holds or evades eye contact. In a mask and visor, I feel less like a GP than an old-school surgeon, oblivious and insensitive.

Two “Covid hubs” were set up in Edinburgh just before lockdown came in: one for telephone triage and one for face-to-face assessments. (A third was opened a week or two later, but then closed, because there weren’t enough patients to justify it.) The idea was to keep patients with coronavirus away from their usual GP surgeries, where risk of cross-infecting others was high.

I spent the evening of 19 March at the telephone triage hub, when cases were still climbing steeply, with a glued-and-Sellotaped headset, one finger in my uncovered ear, speaking to patient after patient reporting the same pattern of symptoms: a dry irritating cough (as the virus irritates the upper airways), lack of smell (as the nose becomes infected), headache, a tight chest, fever, and a bone-weary, sagging exhaustion. A few complained of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, as the virus upset the digestive tract. And fear: everyone was frightened by what they had heard about this virus.

The sickest patients were directed to the other Covid hub for a face-to-face assessment, and I began work there the following week. There is an efficient system in place to keep staff and other patients safe: each patient is met at the door by a nurse in mask, gloves and apron, and has their name and date of birth checked. The patients are given a mask and gloves to put on themselves. They are led down a corridor to the assessment room – a freshly mopped, stripped-out clinical space – and offered a seat. The doctor waits outside the room, puts on mask, apron gloves and visor, and goes in once the patient is alone.

My training as a GP emphasised the importance of building empathy and rapport, but on shift in the Covid hub I stay as far from the patient as possible until the moment of actually examining them, even taking their medical history from the far side of the room. I remember seeing a middle-aged man there who had flown in from Italy not long before lockdown. Another who had caught the virus at his mother’s funeral. A builder who’d had a sick workmate on the last site he worked before lockdown. A young mother who thought she’d caught it on the train from London.

On shift one Thursday evening, we all stopped at 8pm to listen for the sound of clapping, but the clinic is surrounded by hospital buildings, and the night was silent. “It makes my toes curl anyway,” said one of my colleagues. “I’ll be glad when it stops.”

“I like it,” I said. “It’s the one time of the week I get to see all my neighbours.” For me, those Thursday rituals are far more about people cheering one another, than they are about thanking the NHS.

Scotland was at an earlier stage in the spread of the disease as lockdown came in; even so, nationwide distancing measures should have come in earlier – by early April, with the upswing in cases steepening, we could all see that. Making call after call, seeing patient after patient, I thought how we’d been like toddlers on the beach, watching the waves edging ever-closer up the sand, but still squealing with shock when the water rolled over our toes.

On 3 April, Boris Johnson, at home isolating with coronavirus, posted a video online. He was visibly overbreathing, interrupting his sentences to take brief gasps. Two days later, he was admitted to hospital, and on 6 April he was moved into intensive care. The BBC was publishing flow charts of how the transition of power would work if the prime minister died.

The trajectory of his illness was by now familiar: a week or so of flu-like symptoms, and then, between day seven and day nine, just as most patients start to improve, the onset of worsening breathlessness. Covid-19 has been called a “biphasic” illness, for these two phases – the first “virological”, as the body confronts the virus, and the second “immunological”, as misdirected messages from the immune system thicken the lungs and the lightest, airiest part of the body becomes sodden with fluid.

In my part of Lothian, there are usually two cars providing emergency GP home visits at the weekends and in the evenings. A few days after Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital, I was out in Car 2, driving to a visit in the most urgent triage category, which means getting to the patient within one hour. The experience was a fairly typical snapshot of what it’s like to make home visits as a GP right now. On the phone, the patient had said that after a week of flu-like symptoms he was breathless even when lying on his sofa, and had a fever. It was early evening as I drove to his house. Westering sunlight was turning the suburban streets golden and blackbirds were singing in privet hedges. I phoned the patient from the car for directions. His breath came in gasps, his sentences interrupted.

“Are you alone?” I asked. Yes. “Can you sit near the door?” Yes. “Just to warn you, I’ll be wearing an apron, mask, visor, gloves. I’ll give you a mask and gloves to wear, too.” OK. “If you sit near the door, it’s easier for me – I won’t have to come all through the house to find you.” OK.

I ignored the twitching curtains of the neighbours, the kids out on their bikes. Earlier in the shift, leaving another home visit, a patient had asked me, “Can you shout to the neighbours that I don’t have Covid?” Now I stood at the back of the car, opened the boot, and began The Great Faff – another new protocol to get accustomed to. Thermometer, oxygen sensor, stethoscope, all placed into a clear plastic bag. Apron on, mask on, gloves on. Then a second pair of gloves over the first. The apron flew about in the wind. (Some of my colleagues have been sellotaping the thin flapping plastic to their legs.) Visor on last – its frame was 3D-printed in green plastic, with clips for attaching a head strap to the back, and a clear acetate shield to the front. On the inside of the forehead band was written Car 2 in permanent marker.

At the patient’s front door, which was ajar, I breathed in the smell of stale cigarette smoke. The man was sitting on a stool just inside the door, elbows on his knees, bracing his chest with his arms to better move air in and out of the lungs. He was wearing grey pyjamas that had lost a couple of buttons.

“How are you doing?” He grunted an acknowledgement. “Can you manage on with one of these?” I handed him the mask, but he couldn’t tie the strings of it. Wishing my forearms weren’t bare, I leaned over him, holding my breath, and knotted the ties at the back of his head and neck.

I counted his breaths – fast, at 28 per minute. I put a digital thermometer in his ear and it flashed red with an impressive fever. I put an oxygen sensor over his finger – by shining light through the skin, it can gauge the oxygen content of the blood. His was worryingly low. His pulse, even sitting down, was galloping along at more than two beats a second.

“Could you stand up for me?” I asked. We shuffled awkwardly on the small landing in a doleful dance. He turned his back and I lifted his pyjamas to place my stethoscope on his back. The sound of air through his lungs was accompanied by a quiet hissing sound, like sizzling fat. The sound of pneumonia. In his case, pneumonia probably caused by Covid-19.

“I’m going outside, then I’ll phone you about what happens next,” I told him. I picked up the clear bag with my stethoscope, oxygen sensor and thermometer, and stepped out, trying to hold central to my awareness and every action that there was virus on the walls, the door handle, my gloves and all my equipment.

Out on the doorstep I gulped down the fresh air, then it was back to the rigmarole: topmost layer of gloves off and into a waste bag. Still wearing my underlayer of gloves, I took a chloride wipe and began to clean all the equipment – stethoscope, oxygen sensor, thermometer – and placed them into yet another clear plastic bag, ready for the next patient. The wipe went into the waste, then my apron. Next it was the visor’s turn to get cleaned, and afterwards I placed it on the ground to dry. Then undergloves off, mask off, the clinical waste bag tied off and sealed, and back into the car.

With the donning and doffing of PPE, and cleaning all the equipment, home visits now take far longer than they used to. I’d be happier wearing a gown in addition to the gloves, mask and visor – it would better protect my arms, trunk and legs from droplets carrying the virus. But for now, there are no gowns available. A few days earlier, I had looked through the supplies of gloves and masks that had been delivered to my practice from central government stores: the masks were stamped with the name of a Canadian company, manufactured in China, and distributed by another in Germany. My gloves were all manufactured in Malaysia or Vietnam. If we’re to get this equipment to the people who need it in the UK, we need manufacturers here – and production should have started in January.

From the car I dialled the man’s number again. All those years learning about personal consultation styles, and now I was breaking bad news by telephone from a car parked outside. As I waited for him to pick up, I glanced at the car mirror. My forehead was stamped with Car 2 in reverse, transferred in sweat from the visor headband.

“I think it’s likely that you have coronavirus,” I heard myself say, “and that it’s affecting your lungs, causing pneumonia. That’s why you feel so breathless.” Silence. “I’ll arrange for an ambulance to come and take you to hospital.”

I waited. His breathing was audible. “Is there anything you’d like to ask?”

“How long for?” he said.

“I don’t know.”

Heading on to see the next patient, I passed the ambulance I’d just called, on its way to collect him. The paramedics both waved, and I waved back – one, who wasn’t yet wearing his mask, smiled. One of the few consolations of this pandemic is its grim camaraderie, a new fellowship among the fear.

Later on I walked along from the GP clinic to the A&E department to see how my patient had fared. One of the nurses called up his x-ray on the screen: the lungs should be light and spongy, the blackness of air clear against the white of the ribs, diaphragm and heart. But an “infiltrate” had clouded his lungs. Where there should have been a black void, there were speckled galaxies of white.

“How old is he?” the nurse asked me.

“Mid-50s,” I said. “Like the prime minister.”

“Overweight?” she asked. I nodded.

“They’re all like that, up in ITU,” she said. “Strange days.” We paused together for a moment in silence in front of the x-ray, before she had to attend to another patient, as did I.

Throughout April, I watched maps online showing the number of cases growing worldwide, with red dots bloomed into wide circles, like spores in a petri dish. Between 1 April and 15 April they doubled from 1 million to 2 million; deaths tripled from 50,000 to 150,000. Epidemiological studies were published showing that without limitation on its spread, the coronavirus has the potential to cause 30 million deaths, comparable to the Spanish flu of a century ago.

Meanwhile, the lack of testing in the UK, even among healthcare staff, was becoming alarming. One of my colleagues came down with Covid-19 symptoms on a Friday, couldn’t get tested until Monday, and by Wednesday evening we were still waiting for her result. Five days from symptoms to result, five days of not having a GP working. Five days, as well, of the GP’s husband – a hospital doctor – not working, as he, too, had to self-isolate.

If doctors or nurses receive a negative result, and feel well enough, they can go straight back to work. But there are doubts about the effectiveness of the test – even high-quality studies estimate that it’s accurate only about 70% of the time. We’re just hoping that if there’s insufficient virus in our throats and noses to detect, then there’s insufficient to pass it on to others.

As hospital cases plateaued in April, the virus began to take hold in nursing homes. There are two nursing homes on my practice’s patch in Edinburgh; one had an outbreak affecting four or five patients, but it was swiftly and professionally contained. None of the residents died of it. The staff reassured me they had sufficient PPE. I began hearing stories of nursing homes that weren’t so lucky – that had seen every resident infected, and a quarter had died. I also heard of homes that had no protective masks or gloves.

At the same time, it was obvious that, in the wider community, lockdown was helping slow transmission. The numbers in ITUs (intensive therapy units) dropped consistently from a peak around 9 April. We GPs were sent a message of praise from the hospital, thanking us for doing so well at keeping people away. But it was becoming harder to field patient frustration at the shutting down of much of what the NHS used to do. No outpatient clinics, no colonoscopies, no sexual health services, no routine x-rays – so much has been put on pause. Even cancer services have been stripped back to essentials, and many routine lab tests have been cancelled to create capacity for coronavirus testing.

It’s clear that though the lockdown has slashed transmission, it is provoking a silent epidemic of despair. Panic attacks, sleeplessness and plunging moods are all difficulties GPs are encountering daily – tough conversations to have at the best of times, but even tougher on the phone. Within our area of the city, we already know of suicides triggered by bankruptcies and business closures; and of marriages breaking down. Alcohol-induced injuries are up, as are injuries from assaults. Between 23 March and 12 April, there were 16 deaths from domestic violence in the UK – more than triple the still-shocking figure from last year. A police officer friend told me that domestic abuse support lines were experiencing a 30-40% increase in traffic. Samaritans and Childline, too, were receiving high volumes of calls. A domestic abuse hotline for NHS workers had been inaugurated – intended to support both health workers at risk, and to offer advice should they suspect patients of being abused. When I check routine blood tests on my patients, I have been seeing new flares of liver irritation, which suggest rising levels of alcoholism.

Many whose mental health was already tenuous before the crisis now feel unmoored, desperate and angry. The inescapable uncertainty that comes with the disease is particularly difficult to live with, and I’m grateful, as a GP, to at least have reliable work. For those whose jobs offered identity and a sense of purpose, being furloughed has been a tragedy exacerbated by forced disconnection from friends and family. Many children, my own included, are missing the structure and social life of school, and every day I hear of more best-laid plans being added to the bonfire of this global crisis.

The UK maintains relatively few critical care beds in comparison with its neighbours. Before this crisis, there were around 40 ITU beds in Lothian for a population of 850,000.. Now that number has been increased to 113. With the new critical beds added, the UK is at roughly the same levels as pre-pandemic Italy and Bulgaria.

The peak of Covid-19 bed occupancy in Lothian’s ITUs was on 9 April, when there were 42. Ten days later there were 30, and they stand now at 11. A friend who is an ITU consultant in the Midlands told me that only four in 10 of his patients who are intubated due to Covid-19 survive it.

On Sunday 10 May, Boris Johnson relaxed some lockdown measures for England, while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland kept their own stricter measures in place. Johnson encouraged a return to work, but asked people to avoid public transport, and said that driving to work and to places for exercise would be permitted. I asked my ITU friend what he thought of the speech. “No mention of facemasks in public? Everybody in their cars? I think it’s an experiment at the expense of the English,” he said.

On 7 May, the first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, had extended our lockdown, shortly after recommending the use of “cloth face coverings” on public transport, in shops and in places where physical distancing isn’t possible. On 10 May, she announced that she had “asked the UK government not to deploy their ‘stay alert’ advertising campaign in Scotland”. The message in Scotland, Sturgeon said, was not “stay at home if you can”, but “stay at home full stop”.

The lockdown has already had profound social and economic consequences. It’s likely that unemployment is going to soar this summer, and unless robust housing legislation is put in place, so will evictions. On my occasional work at the Access Practice, a GP clinic providing health services for Edinburgh’s homeless population, I’ve seen how they’re preparing for a surge in need.

In late March, the Scottish government, public health officials, charities and local authorities came together to mitigate the worst of the pandemic’s effects on homeless people, with an initiative brokered by the charities Streetwork and the Bethany Trust. By the evening of 24 March, 80 of the city’s rough sleepers had moved into rooms in one of the city’s empty hotels. With homeless shelters closing to minimise the spread of Covid-19, another hotel was opened as a temporary night shelter. Mobile outreach clinics were set up in each hotel, and rapid detox and methadone programmes initiated for those who needed them.

I was due at the outreach clinic in one of the hotels last week, but just before attending, I came down with a viral headache. I felt weak, nauseated and feverish, so instead of going to the clinic I went to a test centre, where a knitting needle of a swab was plunged into the depths of my nose.

While waiting for the result, I phoned Rankin Barr, the service manager of Streetwork, to arrange a visit to the outreach clinic, and asked him about the effects of the lockdown. “The people presenting for emergency shelter are not your traditional rough sleepers,” he said. “Many are coming from domestic problems, relationship breakdowns – with lockdown they can’t stay with family, can’t go to B&Bs.” We spoke of how much had been done so far – of the rapid setting up of clinics, of food provision, immigration advice and vaccination programmes, and how the city council was even now procuring more emergency accommodation for the emerging social crisis. The calamity of the pandemic has triggered a new attitude and approach to the city’s chronic housing shortage. “This virus has changed everything, but there’s an opportunity from now to do things differently,” Barr told me. “The city and public health authorities are completely on board. We just can’t lose all the vital work that’s been done.”

My result came through: negative. I felt better, and will be able to visit the outreach clinic later this week. On the phone recently, I asked one of the doctors organising treatment for the homeless, John Budd, how many cases he’d had to deal with. “We’ve been lucky so far – unbelievably, there has only been one confirmed case. That’s perhaps symbolic of just how marginalised the homeless are from society. But when it enters this relatively closed community, it will spread like wildfire,” he said. “But this virus is like Voldemort,” he laughed. “We know it’s out there, we just don’t know when it’s coming back."

The infectious diseases team at the Western General had practised for a pandemic. Within 24 hours its plan was under way.

View image in fullscreen A coronavirus patient is bathed in the intensive care unit

By early February, a building with dozens of single rooms dedicated to older people, rheumatology and orthopaedics was requisitioned as an emergency treatment facility, and a community-testing unit and a contact-tracing protocol was trained and mobilised. Full personal protection equipment (PPE) became mandatory and the intensive care unit started to expand, in time tripling its capacity.

And it worked, said Dr Claire Mackintosh, the Western’s clinical director for infectious diseases. “We completely changed the Western. Things which would have previously taken months, within 24 hours we created whole new teams and approaches, with real buy-in from the management.”

View image in fullscreen Above: Dr Rosie Callander keeps her pen handy. Right: Louise Allan, intensive care nurse, tends to a patient

Everyone who had come from Wuhan with a cough or fever was tested. Nurses were despatched to people’s homes in full PPE, using a specially equipped infectious diseases ambulance. Routine intravenous antibiotic treatments for ill and vulnerable patients were immediately moved from the hospital into people’s homes, to protect their health. Macintosh also organised drive-through testing in the Western’s grounds – the first in the country.

Dr Rosie Baruah, the Western’s critical care consultant, said this was a first for the hospital, and a first for its teams. “We’re not London. We haven’t had a London Bridge [terror attack] or a 7/7 or had to suddenly look after a huge number of critical care patients. This is pretty much once in a lifetime,” she said.

By the time Edinburgh’s first confirmed Covid-19 case was detected in early March, the Western had tested about 600 people for the virus. Many were quarantined in the newly requisitioned infectious diseases building, occupying beds for at least 48 hours as their samples were dispatched to Colindale in north London for analysis.

The Western was effectively split in two – red wards and units for Covid-19, green wards for non-coronavirus medicine. Wards were emptied in preparation; specialist consultants and nursing staff quickly retrained for critical care and infectious diseases.

Above right: recovering coronavirus patient Robin Edwards who has been in hospital for many weeks but hopes to be discharged soon.

Unsure at the time about its infectiousness, virulence or the full range of symptoms, they treated every potential case with great caution. Meanwhile the “case definition”, the factors in a patient’s story that flagged them as at risk for Covid-19, kept on broadening, first to include travellers from China and south-east Asia, then to northern Italy.

They take off gowns, gloves, hat and visor on the infected side of the exit tent as they leave. Inside the tent they remove their masks and wash their hands before exiting the other side of the tent

That meant lots of locals who had taken February half-term skiing holidays in the Italian Alps and were experiencing shortness of breath and coughs were being tested; by 12 March, the Western had to drop its contact-tracing and community-testing programmes to focus on admissions.

In common with hospitals across the UK, the Western’s ICU had to expand, doubling its normal 16-bed capacity by taking over recovery rooms alongside operating theatres, which in turn became identified as potential ICU rooms if capacity needed to be tripled. In the event, Baruah said, ICU cases peaked before operation theatres were needed. The hospital has treated about 40 patients in intensive care since March, she said, with no cases of her staff falling ill from cross-infection.

But, for now, running two separate intensive treatment units will be the norm. Once the lockdown eases, Baruah expects routine emergencies and surgery critical care cases to rise, while the ICU is still treating a handful of critical Covid-19 patients and braced for a further outbreak. Those cases will need comprehensive separation and infectious disease protocols.

“There are so many unknowns,” Baruah said. And that fed anxieties and a sense of expectation among the staff. “I would much rather plan for a second peak and for it not to happen,” she added. Even so, both Mackintosh and Baruah agreed, this crisis had tested the Western and their procedures had worked. “In terms of our resilience for dealing with future pandemics, this will stand us in good stead,” said Baruah."

In the last fortnight we have seen that our sense of compassion is alive and well as people rush to volunteer, donate, and protect neighbours and loved ones. Our country is a compassionate one; we care about each other and want to protect each other from harm.

But the crisis has also shone a harsh light on some fundamental flaws in the fabric of our society; labour market regulations that do not protect workers and a social security system that pulls people into poverty. We have collectively failed to protect our social safety net.

In the coming months, there is a very high risk that many more people will be swept into poverty. We must focus efforts on the groups who are most at risk to the health impacts of the coronavirus, and we must also recognise the very real and disproportionate impact that will be felt by people on low incomes.

Workers in some sectors such as hospitality and retail face the prospect of unemployment as their employers struggle to survive, whilst those in precarious work are likely to see their income collapse completely. People who remain in work and are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay while they are forced to self-isolate will have to survive on a paltry £94.25 a week. If schools close, families reliant on free school meals may struggle to stay afloat. But we can take action to ensure that people on low incomes can keep their heads above water.

Some welcome measures have been introduced to address aspects of these challenges, but far more is needed.

We are already engaging with Poverty Alliance members to identify the steps that should be taken – by all levels of government as well as by civil society – to respond to this unfolding crisis. But we also need an immediate short-term response.

We are calling on the UK Government to:

Increase social security payments to meet people’s needs

We know that social security payments do not reflect the cost of living but thousands of people will be forced to turn to Universal Credit as job losses begin to increase.

Recent years of benefits freezes and other changes to our social safety net have left the main rate of unemployment benefit lower than in the early 1990s despite growth of more than 75 per cent in the overall economy. Social security benefits must now be significantly increased. We need to see basic allowances for Universal Credit and ESA doubled from the current level of £73.10. Topping-up child benefit by at least £10 a week would also make a significant difference to families who are struggling to stay afloat. We also need to end the benefit cap to ensure that social security benefits match family needs.

Make Universal Credit payments immediately available

The five week wait for first payments of Universal Credit is already driving destitution across the country. With more people expected to turn to Universal Credit in the coming weeks and months as a result of the economic impact of the virus, we must immediately end the five week wait by making advance payments non-repayable.

Increase Statutory Sick Pay to match the real Living Wage

Increasing numbers of workers will need to self-isolate in jobs where working at home is not possible. People working in low paid sectors are more likely to rely on Statutory Sick Pay. Statutory Sick Pay should be significantly increased from its current level of £94.25 to £349 a week to match the real Living Wage, and the qualifying wage of £118 should be removed. The UK Government should provide support to employers to pay this.

Any temporary measures to provide adequate incomes or protect workers who are sick should be made permanent.

Enable employers to retain staff

We support the idea of a Statutory Retention Pay (SRP) scheme though which firms can retain staff who have no work to do during the crisis. Employers should be compensated by the Government to pay workers at the real Living Wage.

Implement a freeze on utilities, including the internet

Being able to afford energy bills and internet access will be crucial in the coming months as families are forced to stay at home whilst also seeing their incomes cut significantly. Up to 15 per cent of households in Scotland do not have home internet access and more than 600,000 households already live in fuel poverty. Internet access will be especially vital for children as schools move to online-only learning. We urgently need the UK Government to work with utility providers like energy companies and internet providers to implement a freeze on utility bills to ease the pressure on people struggling to cope.

We are calling on the Scottish Government to:

Provide emergency cash support for families

The Scottish Government has made a welcome commitment to provide alternative arrangements for families who usually rely on free school meals. This support should be provided through direct cash support to help keep these families afloat.

Support for people in the rented sector

People living in the rental sector are most likely to be living in the grip of poverty, with people living in the private rental sector particularly at risk. While the UK Government has announced measures to protect home-owners with mortgages, there is as yet little protection for renters. The Scottish Government should support measures like rent freezes – as well as a ban on evictions – that would ease the pressure on people who are struggling to cover their rent during this time.

Support for community and voluntary organisations

Community organisations provide vital support for families and individuals facing poverty all through the year. But in the midst of this crisis they will be under pressure like never before. Many trusts and charitable funders have already made commitments to continue to support groups and organisations. Additional financial support from the Scottish Government is essential if community organisations are to survive and deliver the support needed at this time.

The action we take to protect our most vulnerable in the coming weeks will be a real test of our shared values of justice and compassion.

While urgent action from Governments is paramount, community organisations will be providing vital lifelines to families in the coming months. At Poverty Alliance we want to know how we can best support people living on low incomes at this difficult time. To do this, we will be reaching out to our members to find out how the crisis is affecting them and the organisations who support them, and to understand what protections the Poverty Alliance should to be pushing for in the coming months.

To tell us what issues are affecting you/your services and/or to suggest solutions we should be pushing for, please email Suzi at suzi.murning@povertyalliance.org by Thursday 26th March."

Update 25.03.2020 - Closure of The Bagpipe Shop Online Store

With the latest restrictions on movement, The National Piping Centre’s online shop, The Bagpipe Shop, has closed. As staff members are required to be in store to facilitate the fulfillment of orders, meet post and more, it was felt that this was an unnecessary risk to the team, meaning that The Bagpipe Shop has now closed online, as well as its physical stores.

If you have placed an order since 12noon on Monday 23rd March, you will be contacted directly by a shop member to discuss options for your goods. If you were waiting for an order, where a product was still to reach The National Piping Centre, please contact us directly and we can discuss further options with you.

The National Piping Centre is disappointed to have to close its online shop at this time, but feels that for staff and public safety this is the right course of action for these times.

We hope to welcome you back as soon as we reopen.

The NPC Closed - 23.03.2020

In light of the ongoing global health risk posed by COVID-19, we’ve taken the difficult decision to close The National Piping Centre for the time being.

Of course, this is incredibly disappointing news for us to share with you, but the well-being of our students, staff, customers and visitors will always be a top priority to us. Our position as a school, restaurant, shop and tourist destination means we have a responsibility to help reduce the further spread of this pandemic.

We have already moved to Skype teaching as much as we can, but from 5pm on Friday 20th March, both the National Piping Centre venues at McPhater Street and Otago Street will be closed to the public until further notice.

As mentioned, Skype Lessons will be going ahead and we are looking at exciting new ways of bringing you lessons and more. In the meantime our teachers would encourage you to keep up the work on your practice chanters, listen to whatever great piping you can, look at new tunes and brush up on your favourites.

The Bagpipe Shop is still open online, with order fulfilment on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays. The restaurant, hotel and public teaching areas will be completely closed, with The Bagpipe Shop closed to walk in customers. However we are creating great new menus for you to come back to and our great drinks selection is on ice, ready and waiting.

We are continuing with our online lessons, social media pages with ideas and teaching and wedding blogging, as well as posting news over on Bagpipe.News all about the latest events in the piping world. We’ll continue to follow the advice of the UK Government and relevant local and global health authorities and will keep you updated as to when we will re-open to staff and the public. We will continue to keep you updated and when we do reopen, we hope you will come and see us soon.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused and thank you in advance for your patience and understanding."

What is the Coronavirus?

Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the illness caused by a new strain of Coronavirus. It can cause a cough and/or a fever/high temperature. Latest guidance about COVID-19 from NHS Scotland and the Scottish Government can be found here: https://www.nhsinform.scot/coronavirus

Policy and Legislation

The Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020 received Royal Assent and came into force on Tuesday 7 April 2020. More information can be found here: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2020/7/contents

The Act introduced various measures of relevance to the delivery of community justice in Scotland, including the early release of some people from prison; extending the length for completion of all current community payback orders that include an unpaid work or other activity element by 12 months; an option to further vary or postpone community orders en masse as required; measures to allow the virtual delivery of justice processes include remote juries and Parole Board hearings.

The Coronavirus (Scotland) (No.2) Act was introduced in the Scottish Parliament on 11th May 2020 and passed Stage 3 on 20th May, introducing a range of further measures modifying justice delivery, including the extension of time limits for criminal proceedings.

Further detail about this legislation can be found here: https://www.parliament.scot/bills-and-laws/bills/coronavirus-scotland-no2-bill

These Acts introduced these measures for a time limited period (initially 6 months with the potential for extension, to a maximum of 18 months total), due to expire in September 2021. The Coronavirus (Extension and Expiry) (Scotland) Act became law on 4 August 2021, extending Part 1 of both Coronavirus (Scotland) (No.2) Act and Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020 until 31 March 2022. This means that the changes to the law in Part 1 of each of these Acts will continue to be the law until that time. This Act also allows secondary legislation to be used to extend Part 1 of each of these Acts further, to 30 September 2022.

Further detail about this legislation can be found here: https://www.parliament.scot/bills-and-laws/bills/coronavirus-extension-and-expiry-scotland-bill

The Coronavirus (COVID-19): framework for decision making was published on 23 April 2020. It sets out the challenges Scotland faces during COVID-19 and outlines the approach and principles that will guide the Scottish Government as it makes decisions about transitioning out of the current lockdown arrangements. Read more: https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making/

Published on Thursday 21 May 2020, the Scottish Government’s route map gives an indication of the order in which they will seek to change current restrictions. It provides practical examples of what people, organisations and businesses can expect to see change over time. The phasing table will continue to be updated.

The Community Orders (Coronavirus) (Scotland) Regulations 2021 https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2021/144/contents/made approved by the Scottish Parliament in March 2021, vary Unpaid Work (UPW) or Other Activity Requirements in existing Community Payback Orders (CPOs) by reducing the number of hours imposed in each order by 35% (with some exceptions*). The purpose of the regulations is to reduce pressure on Justice Social Work services arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.

*Exceptions apply as follows:

It is with great sadness that we must announce that the Edinburgh International Book Festival will not take place in August this year due to the risks surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic.

This is not a decision we have taken lightly, however the safety of our authors, audiences, supporters, staff and suppliers, and also that of the people who live and work in our wonderful city, is of paramount importance.

A message from Book Festival Director Nick Barley:

“So often you tell us the Book Festival in August is a highlight of your year, and it feels very strange that our marvellous tented village of joyful, inspiring, thought-provoking events won’t be taking place in 2020. We will certainly miss seeing everyone coming together in Charlotte Square Gardens.

We very much hope to be able to programme a series of online events to take place this summer. We don’t know yet if this will be possible, or what form it might take, but offering a place where writers can share their stories, ideas and perspectives with others is what we do, and we’ll be exploring the options available to us to help writers continue to connect with readers.

We will be back! The Edinburgh International Book Festival is an integral part of Scotland’s cultural life, and we will return next year. In the meantime, please keep reading and please keep supporting your local independent bookshops, many of whom are offering a mail order or door drop delivery service.

We very much look forward to seeing you all next year. Look after each other and stay safe.”

We will continue to keep you updated via our social media channels. You can access a huge range of past Book Festival events for free via our YouTube channel and podcasts on Apple Podcasts, Acast and Spotify."

This should now be the norm and not the exception.”Is unequal access to technology an issue in your community?","barriers, online, support, access, text, learning, tech, digital, inclusion, books, technology","Access and online barriers

Internet spaces and digital resources open up so many possibilities for connecting, learning and working with others. But not everyone has the chance to move about easily, understand what’s going on, and feel included in online settings.

As a disabled person I am always aware of the barriers which affect me – for example stairs and loud spaces. If I’m moving through the city and there’s a staircase, I am stopped in my tracks and can’t keep moving to access whatever is beyond the stairs. Like a city filled with stairs and steep curbs, the internet is full of potential barriers.

At the moment I can take part in work, learning and social connection online using a laptop I got from Disabled Students Allowance. It has mind-mapping and text-to-speech software which help me as a neurodivergent worker, and it would be impossible for me to work without it. Just being able to watch some music videos or email a friend (or, the more high tech version: sing karaoke with a friend over Zoom) can make a huge difference for wellbeing. Access to digital technology is an important equality issue – during the lockdown and all the time.

Just as we can build more accessible cities (and add ramps and curb cuts to our existing landscapes), we can create more accessible and inclusive online spaces.

Barriers for families accessing technology

Cost is a key barrier when it comes to technology, as physical hardware (laptops, phones, chargers, Wifi routers) and access software can all be very expensive. For households without this technology the coronavirus lockdown and closure of schools and libraries can mean getting cut off from internet access.

The complexity of online platforms and software can also be a barrier. There are some good resources for improving your digital skills, but we shouldn’t expect everyone to become a tech expert. While online translation tools can be useful, language barriers also shape how people experience online spaces.

As well as these barriers, not all formats meets different peoples’ needs. When suitable formats are not available, people whose communication needs aren’t met are put at an extra disadvantage. For example, paper books can be a barrier to learning for dyslexic children.

One Mum in Perthshire talked to us about how her family has found ways to access the right support and tech, including around Dyslexia-friendly formats. She said her children would benefit from access to the same reading books as their peers, but in a digital format using text to speech. Currently, schools don’t have digital copies of all books, so children with lower reading ages (i.e. because of dyslexia) may only be able to access books written for younger children. This is a barrier to learning vocabulary and creative writing skills – and to enjoying reading – which doesn’t have to exist.

“I wish the whole school curriculum from primary through to secondary and beyond would be available in a digital format for children with additional support needs like dyslexia.”

Getting access to assistive technology

Assistive technology, from tablets to text-to-speech software can remove barriers and help people engage, in school learning and many other settings.

When her children can access the right technology, the parent we talked to said it “does make a difference to their independence with learning and therefore their confidence and self-esteem.”

She highlighted that other families will have a harder time dealing with these kinds of barriers. Living more remotely, having less information, and not having a formal diagnosis can add to barriers.

This is a particular issue during the pandemic, as many families rely on technology available in schools, libraries and other services. Dyslexia Scotland and Enquire’s online tools for access to learning may be helpful for families dealing with tech barriers at home. CALL Scotland’s information about assistive technology and software can also be a useful resource.

Ways to remove digital barriers

Thinking about these communication barriers is important for growing a culture of inclusion. Some very quick tips are to think about:

Images: If you share images online, include a text description.

Sound: If you share an audio or video clip, include a text transcript of sounds and what’s said.

How text looks: The font should be sans serif, size 14+. Read about Dyslexia friendly formats. If you can, provide an audio copy and a short version of long texts.

How text reads: Texts should be clear and simple, with short sentences and paragraphs

Technology requirements: What kinds of tech do people need to use to access the information or take part?

Format flexibility: Can people change the format, for example copy-and-paste the text to translate online or download it as a Word document to access with a braille display device?

Other things which help include raising awareness about the barriers people face, online and offline. Peer support networks also play an important role for people experiencing barriers. Many peer support spaces are moving online, like Enable’s online community for people who have learning disabilities.

Ideas for making tech accessible

People are working together in inspiring ways to make technology accessible. Wavelength offers free radios to people 70+, and some communities have re-distributed unneeded tablets so people self-isolating can stay connected.

Technology libraries might be a solution in the future. Tool libraries in Scotland are proving that sharing resources helps communities do more. At the moment we can borrow books and DIY tools for free in Scotland – maybe laptops and assistive technology should be next. We can definitely do more as a society to remove barriers to digital inclusion.

“I would like to see more support for families with accessing assistive technology for home supported learning. There is the expense with buying a PC or tablet and then not all learning programs/apps or audio books are free for home use. I am grateful at present that during the Covid-19 pandemic access to some of these programs and audio books have been made available free for home learning. This should now be the norm and not the exception.”

Is unequal access to technology an issue in your community? (Hint: it probably is!)

What else can we do to make access the norm and not the exception?"

These challenging times have got us thinking about this quote from American civil rights activist, Coretta Scott King. As we all try and muddle through these uncertain times, one real positive that has come out of this is all the shining examples of compassionate communities that we’ve been hearing.

We’ve heard of neighbours filling up a box to take to the local foodbanks, an online disco for over 50s, people offering to provide tech-support to set up Zoom calling, dog walking, childminding… the list goes on. It shows just how powerful communities can be and how much we care for those around us.

Looking after ourselves can mean avoiding the virus, but it also means looking after our mental wellbeing. For different reasons, some of us are being advised to stay indoors for long periods of time. But it’s still important to keep active and keep well.

Avoiding in-person social contact, does not have to mean avoiding social contact. We know that loneliness can be a huge issue for people in Scotland, whether a person is socially isolated or not. Now, more than ever, we need to be looking out for each other.

We’ve started putting together the following advice, but if you have suggestions for things to add, please let us know.

Are there people who you know who live locally and who might be alone? Or maybe struggling with anxiety or mental health?

Community-building and the coronavirus

As the coronavirus pandemic continues we’re all thinking about how to stay connected and support the people in our communities who are most vulnerable at the moment.

We know that we need to avoid unnecessary social contact to slow the coronavirus. The question many of us are dealing with now is: ‘how can our communities and society adapt to take care of everyone who is affected or self-isolating?’

Outside the Box’s Community Connections worker for the Brechin and Edzell areas, Derek, has been sharing some of the ways local people have been supporting each other. When it comes pulling together as a well connected community, Edzell has particular experience. Because of flooding in 2012 affecting 45 homes and causing more damage, Edzell Flood Group formed to do resilience planning and make sure the village would be well prepared for future situations.

Tip #1: Talk, listen and plan

Well organised community–based groups are well placed to communicate with and support with their communities at this critical time. Whether a community needs to deal with climate extremes or a pandemic, we’ve learned that having conversations about what people will need and planning out solutions together is a good place to start.

Building resilience is a slow process, but every conversation and plan helps to knit the community together. The positive effect of this is that the time you put into strengthening your community now will help it for years to come.

Tip #2: Reach out

In the past few days, the Edzell Village Improvement Society has been even more of a hub of information and ideas in the community. On the Village Improvement Society’s Facebook page they have been sharing official advice and giving locals ways to get in touch to ask for support.

There’s also a Brechin/Ezdell Corona support group where folk are offering help to those who need it, and the Brechin Community Pantry is ramping up its efforts.

Remembering that not everyone uses social media or the internet, it has been important to use flyers and phone calls to communicate while limiting face to face social contact. Being neighbourly and staying in touch with people who might need help makes a big difference!

Voluntary sector organisations have got together to create Community Action Response to encourage everyone to take steps to help communities cope with the virus. You can find out more and download their posters here.

Tip #3: Stepping up to give practical support

Local shops in Brechin and Edzell have been offering a delivery service at no charge, so people more at risk don’t need to go outside to get their groceries. A local barber is offering to travel to people’s homes to give haircuts, and over 50 litres of fresh soup have been cooked to distribute to those who need it.

Doing what we can for one another takes many forms, and there are things people can do even while self isolating. Community Connections worker Derek, is at home ill, but has been reaching out and encouraging people to work together. He told us “It fills my heart with hope and pride when I see the response by the local community to this pandemic from individuals to business. There is a real show of humanity and kindness in action.”

Whether you’re taking care of yourself and others from home, at work or out in your community, remember to follow official advice, wash your hands well, and treat each other with care. Work which has kindness and human connections at its core will shine through in this situation!"
113538,How I Juggle Childcare and Working From Home,https://otbds.org/how-i-juggle-childcare-and-working-from-home/,31/05/2020,Charity,CORONAVIRUS,True,"Like me, many parents will be trying to balance working from home and home-schooling their children.

It’s not easy, but this is my journey so far!

I am used to working from home, so for me this part is normal. But it has now been almost two weeks since the schools closed and it already feels like it has been a whole lot longer than that!

When it was first announced that the schools were closing, I was terrified. I had no idea where to begin teaching my children; the curriculum has changed so much since I was at school. How was I going to be able to manage both?

I had a vision we were going to create a new routine:

Up at the normal time, dressed & breakfast as though we were going to school/work.

Our at home school will start at 9am and consist of work set by the school & online activities – we will cover the whole curriculum.

They will learn life skills, cooking, cleaning etc.

The boys will be so busy, I will be able to work as normal.

In reality, my vision was in tatters by 11am that first Monday morning. Although both boys had been provided with some work from school, it wasn’t a full school days worth. The online activities I found that I thought they might be interested in, kept their attention for 20 minutes at most before they were asking for something else to do! They had also seemed to have lost all their confidence. My youngest had to choose two spelling activities from a list (something he has done since P1). He ended up in tears as he couldn’t make a decision!

This wasn’t going to work, I had done virtually no work and we were all getting irritable and stressed. We needed a new plan!

I realised that for the boys this was a much bigger change to their lives than it was for me. I still had some normality with my work, but they had nothing that was familiar; school was closed, clubs and activities closed and they couldn’t go out to play. I needed to cut them some slack and let them adjust to the ‘new normal’. We took a step back and tried to work out together a way that we could make this work for all of us.

Now, our new routine is something like this:

I get up and start work around 6.30am, so I can have some quiet time to get on before the boys get up.

The boys get up & dressed around 9am and take turns to make the breakfast for us all.

They do the school work that has been assigned through google classroom/glow throughout the day but have breaks to do other stuff. These are a few of the activities they have been enjoying:

PE with Joe Wicks

BSL Sign Language with Natasha Lamb

Fischy Music assemblies

Coding

PE with Joe Wicks BSL Sign Language with Natasha Lamb Fischy Music assemblies Coding The one that didn’t make breakfast makes lunch for everyone

They also get time to do whatever they choose, which has included: baking; doing science experiments from the horrible sciences kits we have; building meccano; watch something on the Discovery Channel. Other times they have helped with jobs around the house/garden.

Some days I set little challenges like: we got lots of potatoes & leeks in our veg box delivery this week, other than potato & leek soup, find a recipe that we can make for dinner. Another challenge for my older son was to come up with something that we have at home that could be used to make kettlebells for his new garage-gym.

We also take time to do our daily outdoor exercise. The boys sometimes go out for a cycle or we go for a walk.

Some days they also help or make dinner.

For us this is working. The more chilled out approach and not thinking that we need to be busy sitting at a desk doing maths and English has made the boys happier, and I am getting more work done. I do worry that they could be falling behind, but I am sure they will catch up with this when school does eventually return. So, for now I am trying to let them have fun, learn new life skills and enjoy being at home. For me, this means that I can get work done but also spend time with the boys during these difficult an uncertain times.

This approach won’t work for everyone. We are all different, we all learn differently and we all work in different ways. You just need to find what works for you as a family and don’t be too hard on yourself all we can do as parents is our best.

The Carswell Halls in Eaglesham played host to a joint Community Connections/Reaching Out to Older Adults in Renfrewshire (ROAR) event. The event was for families, carers, and anyone else worried about falls. It was really helpful for everyone who wanted hints and tips on taking precautions.

The workshop, ‘Stay Mobile Stay Connected’ is a campaign to change the way we think about older people’s health.

The campaign and services are co-produced with ROAR and a group of older adults. The group, including people aged 79 to 92, have created campaign films with their own advice on achieving happiness and health in later life. Learn more about ROAR here.

A new narrative around ageing and falls

ROAR creates practical tips to stay on your feet and to avoid loneliness and falls, as well as campaigning to change how public money is spent.

In Scotland we spend £1.3 million pounds every day treating older people who have had falls. Falls account for 87% of emergency hospital admissions for unintentional injuries in people ages 75 years and over.

The interactive presentation explored strategic, financial and social challenges and opportunities around reducing injuries in older age. It also talked about why we need to build a new narrative and vision about active ageing within the context of wider society. Older people are valuable members of our communities, and it’s always a good time to think about how communities support people as they age.

ROAR’s tips for avoiding falls

ROAR shared these tips for maintaining your mobility and independence with age. For people of all ages who are staying indoors because of the coronavirus, it’s a good idea to add some extra stretches and exercises in your daily routine.

ROAR suggests Yoga, pilates, Tai Chi, or other home videos are all ways of improving and maintaining your balance. Doing these exercises can massively reduce your risk of injurious falls. There are tips and videos online you can use to do gentle exercise from home!

Resources for exercising at home

In this video from ROAR one of their campaigners mentions that standing up and having a dance around your sitting room can help.

Written By SPFL Trust Media Centre on 10 June 2020 8:30 am

We are delighted to announces that the SPFL Trust has received the single biggest personal donation in Scottish football history.

Key headlines:

SPFL Trust reaches agreement with James Anderson to make a substantial donation of over £3m to help clubs and support their communities

Every club will be eligible to receive a £50,000 grant for support during the Covid-19 crisis, provided they evidence community benefit

The donation comes without qualification or preconditions relating to future structure or governance at the SPFL

Funding will also be used to accelerate the launch of a new national SPFL Trust programme, Scottish Football United, which is expected to engage clubs, leagues, governing bodies, and a range of public sector organisations

A separate fund, The Anderson Fund, will also be established

Mr Anderson has confirmed his intention to provide further additional funding, both directly, and possibly via others in his network

James Anderson, a fund manager and partner with Baillie Gifford, has gifted the charity £3,125,000 inclusive of gift aid.

A Covid-19 crisis fund is to be launched by the SPFL Trust, to which all 42 SPFL clubs will be eligible to apply to, for a fixed grant of £50,000. Clubs will be able to use the grant, provided they are able to demonstrate support for the wider community in which they are based. This will be a condition of the grant.

This personal donation has been made without qualification or pre-condition relating to future structure or governance at the SPFL.

We will also now accelerate plans for a major new project called Scottish Football United. It had previously hoped to secure traditional grant funding in 2021 for a 2022 launch, but will now immediately begin putting plans in place.

Further details will follow, but in principle, Scottish Football United will bring together clubs, leagues, governing bodies, with national and local public agencies to create a focal point for future crisis planning and support. This will enable Scottish football to react and support communities quickly, and at scale.

A new restricted fund will be set up, The Anderson Fund, which will be used to fund new projects, which demonstrate a positive impact on health, attainment, or inclusion as well as any general related support during the Covid-19 crisis. Details of this will also follow.

All 42 SPFL clubs have been involved in the response to Covid-19, again demonstrating their capacity to support those in need, quickly and effectively. Across the SPFL, over 150 different community projects have been built, many from a standing start, to respond to the crisis created by the pandemic.

In response, James Anderson has intimated how impressed he is at the work of clubs and their community trusts. He has also indicated to the SPFL Trust that he intends to provide further funded support, and that other benefactors may be part of these future donations.

“We extend our heartfelt thanks to James for this unprecedented gesture,” said our CEO, Nicky Reid.

“It will enable clubs to access vital funds during these exceptional times, whilst ensuring they can also continue to support the important community work that has been taking place over recent months.

“In Scotland, we often criticise our game, but during this crisis we have seen – once again – that SPFL clubs and their associated charities are trusted to support communities across Scotland. Every club is doing their bit, and so we hope the grants we will now make available will go some way to supporting these efforts.

“James’ donation will also be used to launch one of our biggest ever initiatives, Scottish Football United. We hadn’t expected to be funded for this project until 2022, and so to be able to launch this year is fantastic.

“This project is limitless in its scope of ambition, as we aim to bring together the wider Scottish football community with a broad range of public agencies and organisations, so that football in our country can be best prepared to be at the centre of the response to future crises. We do a lot already, but we will do so much more.”

James Anderson said: “Football is at the heart of communities across Scotland, and there are not many societal organisations that bring people together nowadays, to catch them in a net when they fall. When Covid-19 struck, I realised what a significant loss it would be for towns across the country if their local SPFL club’s very survival was threatened.

“This isn’t just about the passion on the pitch, which is why we love the game, but about the responsibility our clubs take in communities across Scotland. I’ve seen first-hand over the last few years what a difference clubs can make to people’s lives, and so I am very pleased to have been able to offer my support at this difficult time.

“I’m also committing my ongoing support to Scottish football by way of confirming I will make further donations. I have also introduced others who share my values and who are committed to do the same. This is the start of our journey, together. I have great faith in the SPFL Trust, and confidence that they – and SPFL clubs along with their charitable trusts – will take this opportunity and make a great success of it.”

SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster thanked Mr Anderson on behalf of SPFL clubs.

“This extremely generous donation from James will help protect all of our clubs from the very worst effects of Covid-19, enabling them to return to playing as early as it’s safe to do so, whilst continuing to reach out and support communities as they have done throughout the pandemic,” he said.

“We know the positive power our clubs have within their communities. During this crisis, they have stepped up to support thousands of socially isolated and vulnerable people who desperately needed help.

“On behalf of every one of the SPFL’s 42 clubs, I want to sincerely thank James for his timely and extremely generous financial support at this critical moment.”

Find out more about who James Anderson is, and more about his philanthropic work.

James Anderson (60) is based in Edinburgh and is a Fund Manager & Partner at Baillie Gifford, having joined the firm in 1983.

As co-manager of the FTSE 100 listed £11bn Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust and the US based $40bn Vanguard International Growth Fund he has helped deliver great investment success.

Mr Anderson and has family have consequently chosen to make significant donations to charities, the arts and academia.

Benefitting charities have included Médecins Sans Frontières, Save the Children, and Sistema Scotland.

In the arts the Anderson have provided multi-decade support to festivals in Edinburgh including: the Edinburgh International Festival, Edinburgh Book Festival, Edinburgh Film Festival and many others locally.

Mr Anderson funds the global Theatrum Mundi arts charity, and has provided a significant grant to the New York Public Library to help purchase the James Baldwin archive, one of the most powerful voices in 20th century American literature.

He is a trustee of and major donor to the world-renowned Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Mr Anderson is also the Advisory Council Chair for the JHU School of Advanced International Studies Europe, in Bologna.

University of Oxford, University of Sussex and the London School of Economics have also received donations from Mr Anderson and his family.

Having grown up in Norfolk, Mr Anderson is still a Norwich City supporter, and having been at university there also proudly supports Bologna.

During this Covid-19 pandemic, the resilience of the assets Mr Anderson manages has enabled him to continue to offer generous support to many of these organisations. Having seen the crisis engulfing Scottish football over the last few months, he decided he wanted to offer his support.

Written By SPFL Trust Media Centre on 10 June 2020 8:28 am

We understand that football supporters will have plenty of questions following today’s announcement that James Anderson is to gift over £3m to support the game in Scotland, so our team has worked with Mr Anderson to provide a comprehensive Q&A.

How is the funding being used?

The funding is being split into two parts. The cash value of the donation is £2.5m, however Gift Aid can be claimed on this, increasing it to a total value of £3,125,000. James Anderson has agreed that:

£2.1m will be given to clubs

£1.025m will be for the SPFL Trust – comprised of £400,000 from the original donation and £625,000 in Gift Aid

What will the SPFL Trust use their portion of the money for?

The SPFL Trust intends to split its portion of the money, broadly speaking as follows, with further details to follow in due course:

Build a brand-new nationwide campaign called Scottish Football United. Full details will follow, but the campaign will bring together clubs, leagues, governing bodies, public agencies and other external community organisations to create a vehicle in which Scottish football can respond to major issues or crisis, and do so at scale. Plans are being put in place to provide specific support to lower league clubs and their communities

The £625,000 (gift aid) will be used to establish and administer a ‘restricted’ fund, the Anderson Fund. Grants from the Anderson Fund will be spent on new projects, which demonstrate a positive impact on health, attainment, or inclusion as well as any general related support during the Covid-19 crisis

What does James Anderson want in return for his donation?

Nothing, other than to support SPFL clubs and their communities.

Is this to try and benefit or influence Ann Budge’s reconstruction proposals?

No. James Anderson asked Ann to introduce him to Neil Doncaster, as they were not acquainted. Hearts have been no part of the discussions. Mr Anderson has also made it clear that his donation comes without qualification or preconditions relating to future structure or governance at the SPFL.

Are you concerned that this could be viewed as inappropriate by some if Hearts are not relegated?

James Anderson made the request to Ann Budge to be introduced to the SPFL, not the other way around. James Anderson has donated millions of pounds to dozens of sport, art, and academic organisations over many years and has a reputation that is beyond reproach. It is also worth noting that Mr Anderson has been open to every question asked of him by senior colleagues at the SPFL Trust and the SPFL during this process.

There must be some guarantees or stipulations that come with this donation, surely? What are they?

The donation James Anderson is making to the SPFL Trust comes without qualification or preconditions relating to the future structure or governance at the SPFL.

As with any grant charitable grant, the SPFL Trust will have certain standard conditions in place, but for the avoidance of doubt these specifically relate to community benefit, and have no bearing on the future structure or governance at the SPFL.

The only major condition, is that clubs may not use their grant for the provision of staff or player salaries.

Given the likely requirements to enable a return to football, this funding is expected to be able to support work in this area of focus.

For example:

Costs associated with ensuring stadia can attain bio-secure status, enabling the resumption of football, and with it, community activity, much of which take place daily at football grounds across Scotland

Should clubs wish to purchase a Covid-19 testing system, we would expect to see equipment being made available for use to the benefit of the club’s wider community (clubs would not be expected to cover the per head cost of tests conducted by community groups using their equipment)

What is restricted funding?

Charities organise their income into two types: restricted & unrestricted.

Restricted income is applied to a specific project and may not be used for any other purpose. Unrestricted income, may be used by the charity at its discretion, provided that any expenditure is made in accordance with the charity’s own objectives. These are lodged with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR).

Where does Baillie Gifford fit in?

In short, it doesn’t. James Anderson is a partner and fund manager at the firm, having worked there for 37 years, but this donation is a personal one from Mr Anderson.

How does Mr Anderson feel about now being in the Scottish football public eye?

James Anderson is a very private person. He and his family have supported dozens of organisations that they are passionate about and committed to, and they have never sought publicity or attention. They have made these contributions because they are in a fortunate position to be able to do so.

That said, Mr Anderson appreciates that a donation ‘for Scottish football’ is a different ball game. He understands that others will want to understand his motivations, which is why he is using this opportunity to explain them. He doesn’t intend to become someone who speaks regularly about Scottish football, though.

Should the bigger clubs be entitled to a share?

James Anderson wanted to create something equal for all clubs, without condition. Every club has enormous challenges right now, regardless of the size.

It is, however, up to clubs to decide if they wish to make an application for this Covid-19 Crisis Fund grant.

Clubs may decide they do not want to apply for the grant, for their own purposes, but would be welcome to do so with the objective of donating to their associated charity.

Any money that is not distributed (because club(s) choose not to apply) will be made available through a second round of funding, with details established at the time.

Further work will also continue that may provide further support to lower league clubs.

As Mr Anderson has said, he believes this is the start of a partnership.

Why does this support stop with the 42 SPFL clubs?

This particular donation is about the 42 SPFL clubs and their associated charities, who exist as part of the country’s professional league body.

Mr Anderson is considering other areas within football to support. He recognises the power of football at all levels, right across the country.

Does James Anderson have any questions over how the money will be used by each club?

No. James Anderson understands what clubs need right now, and Mr Anderson is supportive. This approach is designed to support clubs and their communities, based on needs that have been well identified.

When will the clubs receive money?

Tomorrow (11 June) clubs will be invited to register an expression of interest in applying for a grant. Subject to fulfilling criteria and completion of paperwork, the SPFL Trust hopes to begin making payments no later than Monday 21 June 2020.

Who are the other benefactors referred to in this media release?

There are other people within James Anderson’s network, but they have requested anonymity from the SPFL and SPFL Trust at this time."

Written By SPFL Trust Media Centre on 30 March 2020 11:50 am

The SPFL Trust has launched our “Trusted to Support” campaign, which will highlight the activity of clubs during the Covid-19 crisis.

As a nation, we find ourselves in unprecedented circumstances. It is vital to let people know about the support and resources that are available to help them at their local club.

The campaign aims to inspire people, players, staff, clubs and interested organisations to share and help each other. The initiatives that range over a variety of areas including; mental health, fitness and education, to name a few, are essential to us all at this time.

Every year our clubs engage in around 750,000 community engagements with people in their communities. Clearly, this is a very different and challenging time, but we’re seeing clubs supporting their communities on a whole range of ways.

The idea behind this simple campaign is to:

Curate and highlight the work of our clubs – it’s a live, real-time campaign and we expect information to change regularly

Highlight to the clubs themselves what’s going on, potentially enabling them to pool resources and work tactically in certain areas

Engage with football supporters and broader stakeholders across the country to show that even in the toughest of times, our clubs are pulling together, in extraordinary ways

You can find a list of clubs and activities here.

Our CEO Nicky Reid said: “It is a challenging time, but our clubs and trusts have stood up and taken unprecedented actions to support their communities. This is why we always say that Scottish football is trusted to support.

“It is not only heartwarming to know so many people from across our sport care, but also that this support is vital to the people receiving it.

“I’m proud of our clubs and trusts, and we hope that our initiative can raise further awareness of these great acts of kindness during these difficult days and weeks.”

best to support learning, teaching and well-being at home. It is a time of great uncertainty affecting all aspects of our lives. Family and friends may be shielding, self-isolating or unwell and there may also be death as a

result of COVID-19. Employment is impacted and our school community is affected through people in key workers roles, working from home, furloughed or jobs lost. It is important to remember as the weeks go by, that school is closed as part of wider measures to save lives.

Therefore, children in P6 and P7 will be allowed to bring schoolbags to school again for a trial period to see how this works.
Face coverings – in line with government guidance for Tier 1, parents are requested to wear face coverings while visiting any school site.
This has been school policy for many years and is there for the protection of all children and for hygiene reasons.
Parent Council – the Parent Council met on Tuesday evening and the minutes will shortly be posted on the school website.","school, children, primary, need, wear, day, newton, classes, pe, parents, start, schoolbags, park","As Highland is now in Tier 1 for Covid-19, there are a number of changes which we can and need to put in place to follow the updated guidance.

Indoor PE – from Monday 9th November, we will be starting to have indoor PE and all classes will have a session of up to an hour once a week.

Your child’s teacher will let you know their day. We have fully risk assessed this and children cannot access the changing rooms so need to change in the classroom. We therefore recommend that they either come to school wearing their PE kit under their clothes so they just need to take off the outer layer and then put it back on again.

However, children do not need to wear shorts for PE and could come to school that day in tracksuit bottoms and wear them for PE without needing to change at all. Likewise, they can have their PE lesson in their usual t-shirt or polo-shirt by just removing their sweatshirt.

They do, however, need to have some type of gym shoes and while most families have provided indoor shoes for children a few have not and children will not be allowed to participate in indoor PE in outdoor shoes if these are not suitable. We have made provision so that equipment is not shared across classes. We will also continue to do the ‘Daily Mile’ two or three times a week to provide exercise on the other days.

Schoolbags – We understand that some parents would like children to bring schoolbags to school, but we have resisted this as we have no storage for these and schoolbags can encourage children to bring more items back and forward from home to school than may be necessary, however, we understand that children in P6 and P7 who are taking home Chromebooks are worried about damage to them while in purple sacs.

Therefore, children in P6 and P7 will be allowed to bring schoolbags to school again for a trial period to see how this works. Children in P6 and P7 do not need to bring their charger to school as we have spare ones for emergencies if needed. Also, please do not put water bottles in school bags along with Chromebooks.

Children in P1-5 have very little to take to and from school and this should fit in the purple sac each day, so no schoolbags in these classes, please.

Morning start times – We would like to continue with our flexible start but tighten up a little on the times.

P4-7 flexible start 8.55 – 9.05 and P1-3 flexible start 9.10 – 9.20.

This will allow us to get started just a little earlier each day while still preventing classes mixing. Children in P1-3 who are in the playground before 9.10 will not be supervised as I do not have staff available for this role.

Face coverings – in line with government guidance for Tier 1, parents are requested to wear face coverings while visiting any school site.

This includes the car park and waiting areas outside the gates and I would be obliged if parents would wear face coverings when accompanying their child to and from school or nursery.

I would further request that we have NO DOGS in the school grounds. This has been school policy for many years and is there for the protection of all children and for hygiene reasons.

Activities next week

Flu nasal spray – Wednesday 11th November 2020.

Armistice – to commemorate the 102nd anniversary of the end of World War I, we will be making a ‘cascade’ display of poppies on the internal stairs in school and will chose two P7 pupils to lay a small home made wreath at this site at 11.02 on Wednesday morning after our 2 minutes silence.

We are hoping to video this to share will all classes and will post it on dojo and the school website so that parents can view this after the event. If time allows we are hoping to make a wreath of little crosses on the hill in the playground and you will be able to see this from the area outside the school main entrance looking down.

We have poppies for all children in P4-7 to wear and sticky on poppy labels for all children.

Children in Need – Friday 13th. The theme of ‘together we can…..’ will be reinforced in many ways in all classes with a range of activities. ]

We ask that children all come to school that day wearing bright colours so that together we can make a rainbow to remember our NHS heroes. No need to buy anything new, just wear whatever colour you like. We will have all sorts of fun activities in school, all of which will be free for everyone to join in.

As both Children in Need and the Scottish Poppy Appeal are charities who are trying to raise money, we will have a collection box in each classroom and will split the money collected between these two very worthwhile causes. We do appreciate money can be tight for many families and would simply ask you to give what you can afford to.

Parent Council – the Parent Council met on Tuesday evening and the minutes will shortly be posted on the school website. I am grateful for their continued support and advice as we steer our way thought this global pandemic while still trying to give the children the best education possible and make sure they have fun in school too."

Update from RYA - January 2021

​

To RYA affiliated Clubs and Recognised Training Centres

​

It would have been nice to be able to be contacting you on more favourable news so early in the New Year but alas Covid has other plans for us right now. Nonetheless there is reason to be optimistic for the near future so may I wish you all a healthy and active year to come.

From Tuesday 5 January, mainland Scotland moved from Level 4 to a Temporary Lockdown, with new guidance to stay at home except for essential purposes. Some islands will remain at Level 3.

In light of this, the RYA Scotland Team have once again revised our guidance with a short overlay to the existing documentation to cover the immediate changes and their implications.



Links for advice for current guidance and support, as well as recreational boating in the UK and abroad are below:

Current Guidance in Scotland

UK Guidance including Wales and Northern Ireland

Coronavirus ( Covid-19) Support and Resources

Let’s be really clear – as limited as it is for now, it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and even though this may not be a first choice through the winter months, this is an important position for our chosen activity. Many have seen their recreational choices stopped completely.

That said we must remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become significantly worse in recent weeks. Travel is severely restricted by law and you may only travel to your boat if it is kept in the same local authority area you live in.

The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to ‘Stay at Home’ wherever possible and we must all do our bit to stop the spread of the virus.

While it is possible for facility providers such as Clubs, Training Centres, Marinas and Boatyards to open to allow access for owners, they will each make their own decisions on whether or not they open their doors or gates to people in the locality.

We ask everyone to respect that facility providers have no obligation to open and you may find access to your boat restricted for the time being. We all hope this will be temporary and many facilities are offering to do key checks and even maintenance to help you out.

If you are fortunate enough to live in an area within which you are able to get to your boat, please consider if you can help out someone else who cannot travel, by checking their boat for them.

Importantly in this lockdown, you may travel within your local authority area to go boating as your form of exercise or for essential maintenance on your boat. For the time being essential maintenance is work which if not undertaken would cause failure or become an imminent safety issue and we suggest examples in the guidance.

However, travel for essential maintenance should not be used as a pretext to spend the day aboard ‘pottering’ or for a weekend away. You should not stay longer than the length of time required to undertake essential maintenance.

I do hope we continue to see some hardy souls getting a float and that your maintenance plans albeit delayed a bit, are not overly affected.

If you have any queries about this most recent guidance please do get in touch with the RYA Scotland Team.

118810,Glasgow Life outlines phased approach to reopening venues with support for childcare and education a priority — Glasgow Life,https://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/news/glasgow-life-outlines-phased-approach-to-reopening-venues-with-support-for-childcare-and-education-a-priority,08/07/2020,Culture,CORONAVIRUS,True,"Glasgow Life has today (Friday 3 July) outlined the phased approach it will take to reopening some of the city’s public buildings in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
As one of Scotland’s largest charities, Glasgow Life is at the heart of Glasgow’s communities; delivering some of the city’s most used and most valued services.
Given this date, Glasgow Life is working with childcare operators to help them reinstate their services as safely and as quickly as possible this month.
Councillor McDonald added: “Like every organisation, Glasgow Life has been hit hard by Covid-19.
However, there are no easy solutions and it’s highly unlikely that Glasgow Life will be able to return to anything like its normal service provision in the near future.","reopening, services, life, public, reopen, phased, staff, venues, glasgow, priority, outlines, education, support, childcare, facilities","Glasgow Life has today (Friday 3 July) outlined the phased approach it will take to reopening some of the city’s public buildings in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

The charity revealed it has prioritised 61 venues and facilities which it intends to reopen across four phases between July and October.

However, its Chair, Councillor David McDonald, who is also the Depute Leader of the city council, said the “considerable impact” of Covid-19 on Glasgow Life’s finances and workforce meant it was facing a very different future.

As one of Scotland’s largest charities, Glasgow Life is at the heart of Glasgow’s communities; delivering some of the city’s most used and most valued services. In 2019/20, more than 18m attendances were recorded across its venues and events.

It has already delivered the first phase of its recovery plan with the reopening of 11 golf, tennis and lawn bowls facilities across the city last month.

The charity’s second phase prioritises the reopening of community facilities to support essential childcare, in line with the Scottish Government’s decision that childcare provision will return from 15 July. Given this date, Glasgow Life is working with childcare operators to help them reinstate their services as safely and as quickly as possible this month.

Phase three will run concurrently with phase two throughout July and will see more of Glasgow Life’s office-based and frontline staff returning to work to prepare venues and services for reopening to the public. Some key tenants will also be given access in this phase.

Meanwhile, phase four, from August to October, will see continued support for childcare and education provision, greater access for tenants, and the reopening of venues to the public more widely, including some of the city’s museums, libraries, arts and sports facilities, in line with ongoing public health and government guidance.

Councillor McDonald said: “After 14 weeks of lockdown, local communities and businesses are understandably eager to reengage with Glasgow Life and we know that demand for the reopening of our venues is extremely high.



“We recognise the challenges will be immense for people in the city who are used to enjoying and, in many cases, rely on our services, but we need to balance that expectation against the complex planning which is now required to reopen any of our buildings.

“As we prepare for a new way of living and working after coronavirus, our fundamental concern must be to ensure that our facilities are safe for our staff and visitors in the weeks and months ahead.”

Due to Covid-19, Glasgow Life has furloughed nearly 1,000 employees while many more are shielding or have underlying health or childcare issues, which has significantly reduced the capacity of its workforce. While the government’s Job Retention Scheme will provide some financial relief, Glasgow Life says it won’t compensate totally for its anticipated full-year losses, which could run into tens of millions of pounds.

Councillor McDonald added: “Like every organisation, Glasgow Life has been hit hard by Covid-19. The complete shutdown of Glasgow’s museums, libraries and sports venues for more than three months, together with the cancellation of most of the city’s events and festivals this year means the millions of pounds of income which supports our services has been wiped out.”

This week, the Scottish Government confirmed that culture, sport, leisure and hospitality services can reopen from 15 July subject to meeting social distancing restrictions.

However, research conducted by the Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions (ASVA), of which Glasgow Life is a member, has found that less than a third of Scottish attractions are planning to reopen on 15 July, and that nearly half of the nation’s museums, galleries, castles and other historic sites may remain closed until 2021.

The survey also found that nearly two thirds of attractions won’t be able to achieve 40% of their normal visitor capacity if two-metre social distancing measures remain in place, while 89% of operators said they were faced with having to take damaging cost-cutting measures this year.

Councillor McDonald said: “Our financial and staffing constraints are unlike anything we’ve ever faced and mean we’re not able to operate all of our venues and services just now; it’s simply not possible.

“Planning around government guidance which is changing regularly, the welfare of our staff, and the viability of adapting our venues to meet social distancing takes time and we have a responsibility to get it right from the outset.

“We’re having to consider this on a venue by venue basis. At the same time, we’re creating an entirely new set of operating practices.

“This includes undertaking risk assessments, testing key building systems, installing screens and public sanitiser stations, delivering revised hygiene and safety training to our staff, implementing new booking systems and engaging with our trade unions. It’s not a case of just reopening our doors and returning to the way things were.

“Social distancing also means that a large proportion of our venues are unable to reopen safely, and we’ll need more staff than before to be working at the venues we do reopen to ensure current restrictions are followed.”

Dr Bridget McConnell, Chief Executive of Glasgow Life, said: “We care passionately about what we do and we’re proud of the difference we make to the lives of Glasgow’s citizens and visitors.

“Without doubt, the effects of this crisis will be felt for some time to come. We need to make the correct decisions now, such as prioritising childcare and education, to help maintain vital services in local communities and support the city’s economic recovery in the longer-term.

“It’s hugely reassuring that Glasgow City Council has agreed to support us financially during this difficult period and we’ll continue to work together to review and prioritise which venues and services we can restart or reopen and when. However, there are no easy solutions and it’s highly unlikely that Glasgow Life will be able to return to anything like its normal service provision in the near future.

“As it has been from the outset, the safety of the public and our staff will remain at the heart of our decision-making.”"

The next Wigtown Book Festival will take place online, organisers announced today (15 May).



Maintaining its pre-announced dates (25 Sept - 4 Oct), the 2020 festival will have two main themes: Resilience and Connection.

Creative director Adrian Turpin said: “A key aim this year will be to raise the profile of Scotland’s National Book Town in Wigtown, its businesses and the cultural attractions of Dumfries & Galloway. The Wigtown Book Festival has a powerful role to play as we all look forward to eventual recovery, when the region will be able to welcome visitors again.

“Nobody wanted this situation but a digital festival gives us opportunities to reach new audiences locally, nationally and internationally.”

Inspired by Wigtown’s rebirth as a Book Town, the Resilience theme will explore the explosion of creativity that has emerged in response to the current crisis. It will also feature a digital showcase for the town’s many bookshops, plus The Kist, a virtual marketplace for artisan crafts and food producers.

Connection will celebrate Wigtown and its region’s international links in a number of events. This will include link-ups with other Book Towns around the world.

As well as live online speaker events, the 2020 festival will feature its usual mix of art exhibitions, film events, music and performance. A crowdfunding campaign will be launched later this summer to help support the festival.

Since March, Wigtown Book Festival has been offering a wide-ranging menu of digital content in response to lockdown, supported by Baillie Gifford. This includes a programme of live-streamed midweek events (#WigtownWednesdays) with writers such as Sally Magnusson, Hallie Rubenhold and Natalie Haynes, new writing commissions and a dedicated festival podcast. All are available on the festival website (wigtownbookfestival.com),

Talking about her involvement in the festival, Sally Magnusson said: “I'm delighted that the Magnusson Lecture will be online and that the festival will bring some of the previous lectures to a wider audience through the creative use of digital. Wigtown has already been engaging wonderfully with audiences during the crisis, and I’ve enjoyed participating myself. I can’t wait for the autumn festival.”

Adrian Turpin added: “We have already put a lot of effort into creating original digital content, because we felt it was vital to engage our existing audiences and attract new ones throughout the crisis. This experience will stand us in good stead as we deliver a fully digital festival this year, with the hope that in 2021 we can all gather together again in one place.”

In addition to the above, WBF20 will feature the following activity with the full programme to be revealed in August:

Heartland ~ a programme of events celebrating the South of Scotland as Scotland’s Literary Heartland

Stories and songs are vital for human survival. They carry our emotions, memories and values. They bind us together as families, communities and a nation, especially through tough times. The Scottish International Storytelling Festival will continue to channel that flow with an increased focus on wellbeing in the year of Covid-19.

The Festival will not do this in packed theatres, but through live and pre-recorded broadcast events, and through small-scale safely distanced person-to-person events, including ones in outdoor locations. All plans are subject to Scottish Government guidance in the autumn period.

SISF Director Donald Smith states:

‘This year’s Storytelling Festival is about wellbeing. Across the nation, we aim to bring many streams into a flowing current of hope and renewal.’

Our online programme will see the return of SISF favourites like our evening gatherings around the Open Hearth, as well as the workshop series Global Lab, bringing performers, educators and activists together to discuss international environmental creativity. We’ll also be premiering Voyage, a brand-new series of work developed by storytellers and musicians, including interpretations of the slave passage across the Atlantic and Scotland’s part in it, the colonisation of Iceland, James VI’s ‘Hamlet’ voyage to Elsinore, Johnson and Boswell’s Tour to the Hebrides and the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition.

Flowing alongside the Voyage series, the Festival will be celebrating Scotland’s own coastline and rivers, collaborating with The Orkney Storytelling Festival and The Wild Geese Festival in Dumfries and Galloway, while the Scottish Storytelling Centre’s Café will hold safely distanced sessions as people rediscover the joy of ‘eye to eye, mind to mind, and heart to heart’.

The Community and Families Programme, which runs from 12 Oct – 30 Nov, will pair local storytellers with partner organisations in online and small-scale live settings, unlocking the ethos of ‘going local’. The Festival’s national reach is supported jointly by Edinburgh City Council and the Scottish Government through the PLACE programme, and these will continue beyond the Festival dates as community-based work again becomes possible.

Gary West, Chair of TRACS says:

‘Now more than ever do we need to be taken on journeys to other places and other times, to see and hear ourselves reflected in them as we are now. I am absolutely delighted that the Festival will go ahead this year, as ambitious and thought-provoking as ever.’

‘Whether joining us from afar or as close-up as circumstances allow, let us gather to celebrate the diversity of the traditional arts of the world.’

In 2020 SISF will present many free though ticketed events, but there will also be an opportunity to donate in support of the performers, and there will be some charges for workshops and studio commissions. Overall, the aim is to support as many performers as possible, and to reach out to as wide a public as we can, locally, nationally and internationally.

The veteran comedian has attended 42 Fringes – and his late-night tours of the Royal Mile have become a thing of festival legend since he started them in 1977.

Today he announced that the walks will still go ahead next month, branding them ‘probably the only show on the Fringe’. Normally there are about 4,000.

Described, tongue-in-cheek, as ‘a piece of radical, site–specific, outdoor promenade performance art’, the tour tells the story of Edinburgh and its festivals without being too constrained by the facts.

One change, apart from the audience being encouraged to wear ‘suitably eccentric’ protective equipment, is that the walks will take place in the daytime, and be family friendly. Although there will be a traditional midnight over-18s show on Saturday August 15 that’s likely to be more rambunctious.

Although traditionally starting at the gates of Edinburgh Castle, this year’s tour will begin in the Pleasance Courtyard at 2pm and 6pm every day from August 8 to 15

Previous tours have included surprise celebrity guests including Steve Coogan, Lucy Porter, Mike McShane, Shappi Khorsandi and Jonathan Ross - plus the occasional glimpse of nudity.

In 2000 Smith and Simon Munnery were arrested on public order offences during the tour after residents called the police at 3.30am. Smith was using a megaphone to lecture a crowd of 200, including Munnery who was playing the part of a German tourist called Heinrich.

BERKHAMSTED, HERTFORDSHIRE, - - 22 year old Alice Hewson has completed her journey from Berkhamsted GC junior to Tour golfer by securing her Ladies European Tour card at the first attempt.





And Berkhamsted members are now looking forward to Friday April 17th, when Alice will return to her beloved home club to host a golf day for her supporters and friends there.





132 players competed for just five 2020 LET cards at La Manga Club in late January, during a gruelling two-week, nine-round Qualifying School .





Hewson finished with a superb four under par 69 in the last round to secure her coveted Tour card by five clear shots. British golfers dominated the final places with Scotland’s Alison Muirhead and Welsh golfer Amy Boulden – this year’s overall LET Q School winner – also getting their cards. Argentina’s Magdalena Simmermacher and Swiss professional Kim Metraux will also join the three on Tour this season.





The globetrotting young golfer, who turned professional in summer 2019 after becoming European Ladies Amateur Champion, is already targeting early-season events in Abu Dhabi, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and California.





As a Category 5c Member of the Ladies European Tour, Alice Hewson will be able to play a full season of LET events in 2020. With 24 events to enter, including 15 in Europe, a record-breaking total prize purse of almost €18 million, and a recent partnership announced between the LET and the powerful LPGA Tour in the USA, the Hertfordshire golfer is thrilled to be joining Europe’s most prestigious Tour for female professionals at such an exciting time.





“I couldn’t have picked a better moment to turn pro, and I am so excited to have gained my LET card on my first visit to Q School” said Hewson. “I’ll be spoilt for choice in this first year. By performing well at La Manga Club I have opened the door to playing in dozens of tournaments around the world in 2020.





“If there was one moment which made me think it could be my week, it was my eagle on the 18th in Round Three. It really set me up for the final weekend. I told myself, someone’s got to be in that final five – so why shouldn’t it be me? ”7/

Hewson also plans to take that positive mindset to the USA in 2020, where she will compete on the Symetra Tour, the official qualifying Tour to the LPGA Tour.





But first, she plans to spend three weeks intensive training in South Carolina at her alma mater, Clemson University, where she graduated last year with an Accountancy degree and a Minor in Legal Studies.





PGA Professional Rob Watts has been Alice Hewson’s performance coach for over six years. He said: “Alice keeps getting better. Her attitude to competing, desire to improve and work-rate are exemplary. Statistically her game is getting close to the best players on Tour, and her potential ball speed is very high.





“Alice’s golfing IQ is tremendous, and she has a massive heart too which means she usually delivers in a pressure situation. You’d want her on your team! She can hit it a long way when she needs to and, unsurprisingly coming from Berkhamsted, she also hits it very straight. To prepare her for life on the LET we’re going to be working on some new routines in the gym, and on adding more aggression to her game – which is what you need to win on Tour.”





Berkhamsted Golf Club Captain Henry Tse said: “Alice has been at the club since she was a seven year-old, and has been winning things ever since. In fact she is our current ladies course record holder, although that may change soon as women are competing in our Berkhamsted Trophy for the first time in 2020.





“Alice has given us a lot to be proud of: among many things she’s played in two Curtis Cup teams, finished strongly in 2019’s first-ever Augusta National Women’s Amateur, and qualified for last year’s Women’s British Open before she turned pro. She was the number one ranked female golfer in England for two years running.





“But most of all we’re proud that she has always returned frequently to Berkhamsted Golf Club, even when she was at college in the USA. Alice sets an amazing example to young golfers everywhere, and we’ll all be riveted when she heads out on Tour.”





During her successful fortnight at Q School, Alice Hewson enjoyed the support of several Berkhamsted GC members as she competed. “Some Berkhamsted members were at La Manga Club while I was playing. They cheered me on, and when I returned straight after getting my card I spent the week back at the golf club.





“People have been absolutely lovely, and I will always have a piece of Berkhamsted in my heart wherever I play in the world.”

Julia Samuel MBE is a psychotherapist specialising in grief, who has spent the last twenty-five years working with bereaved families.

The upheavals caused by the virus on day-to-day life — on our social lives, work routines, schools and childcare — are causing great anxiety, she says, exacerbated by the fact that there is no “template” for dealing with a pandemic. There is a general sense, she says, that “there’s no one in charge that we know is going to sort it. There’s no saviour.” Social media is only compounding anxiety. Rather than catastrophise about an unknown future, she recommends keeping plans on a short timeline: “Don’t project into weeks and months ahead, plan today.” New structures are important too: “We’re very habitual beings. The coffee that you buy, the route that you take, the clothes that you get, even the thoughts that you have down a particular street. You have them habitually as you get to the office. We have to create new structures and habits that give you a sense of agency and efficacy.”

Some of our usual coping mechanisms — alcohol, drugs, promiscuity or extreme busyness — are particularly unhelpful: “If you block pain, you block joy and the capacity to experience all feelings.” Instead, it’s healthier to acknowledge our difficult feelings, with support from friends and family, alongside exercise.

‘Grief Works’ is a compassionate book demonstrating how an examined death is as important as an examined life. It shows us through vivid case studies, that when we face our fears: the death of someone we love, our own death or being with bereaved friends, we are paradoxically, better able to cope with them.

As well as the failure reported today, there are data privacy concerns over the decision to store coronavirus test results in this way.
Some have speculated that while Excel is currently being used to manage coronavirus test results, it is a stepping stone to a more appropriate solution, put in place as a stopgap measure.","coronavirus, technology, used, access, data, experts, slammed, islands, republic, tool, test, excel, wholly, inappropriate, cybersecurity","The news that coronavirus test data was significantly delayed in being added to the UK’s test-and-trace system because of the use of Excel has been met with outrage by IT and cybersecurity experts.

It has emerged that almost 16,000 cases were delayed in being transferred to the test-and-trace system because the government was using an Excel spreadsheet to store the data, with an individual column for each case.

This reportedly caused problems because the maximum number of columns on an Excel spreadsheet is 16,384, meaning the sheet exceeded its maximum size and so failed to update, preventing the coronavirus test data from updating.

Notably, if rows had been used instead, the problem would have been avoided, as Excel supports up to 1,048,576, although many experts are arguing that the software is wholly unsuited to the purpose at all.

“If indeed the government was using Excel to track Covid cases, it is a wholly inappropriate use of the tool,” said Javvad Malik, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4.

“Excel is a very good spreadsheet, but it has its limitations and in no way ever intended to be used as a database.”

Excel “not the right tool” for coronavirus test data

Multiple technology and infosecurity experts have expressed concern over the government’s decision to use Excel for such a sensitive task.

“Whilst the ubiquitous Microsoft Excel spreadsheet can be a useful tool for basic manipulation and analysis of small data sets, it’s clearly not the right tool for the job of correlating and reporting on the national infection rates of the pandemic,” said Matt Walmsley, EMEA director at Vectra.

As well as the failure reported today, there are data privacy concerns over the decision to store coronavirus test results in this way.

“How storing information on medical information in excel files which are then circulated to a wide audience can be seen as anything apart from the outmost temporary of solutions is surprising given the rather strict opinions on data privacy voiced within the European Union over the last few years,” said Martin Jartelius, CSO of Outpost24.

“It is not strange if this was the solution day one, week one, month one, but to see that it’s still in use and having hit the limits of its capacity is more than embarrassing. And to see that the solution has been to “split the file in batches” rather than finding a proper solution to an actual problem even more so.”

A temporary solution?

Some have speculated that while Excel is currently being used to manage coronavirus test results, it is a stepping stone to a more appropriate solution, put in place as a stopgap measure.

“The main benefit of track and trace technology is rapidly being able to notify somebody of any potential exposures. I would speculate that Public Health England are looking to move to a more suitable technology that can provide more granular permissions for users who are creating, reading, updating and deleting information on the current system,” said David Kennefick, product architect at Edgescan.

“Excel may be used to refine the process for implementation into another more suitable technology. The main concerns are: who has access to the data, do they need access, is their access audited and do they have access to only the data that pertains to them being able to perform their tasks in a timely manner.

“Track and trace is very new for most countries, there will be a bedding-in period where these questions must be answered.”

Many are now urging the government to rapidly invest in a more appropriate solution in light of the incident, which not only warped the reporting of coronavirus cases in a UK in a manner that will impair future modelling of the virus, but may have led to some people contracting the virus due to the inability to contact them following their exposure.

“Desktop tools such as Excel should not be used for large datasets, and investment should be made in technology that can securely process large datasets to ensure data integrity and accurate results,” said Paul Norris, senior systems engineer – EMEA at Tripwire.

“Additional problems around spreadsheets are around resiliency and potential data loss, with limited controls on what can be deleted and restored if lost. Backups of this data is harder to manage if in constant use, and security controls need to be adopted to ensure access to the spreadsheet data is not readily available to anyone.”

It also serves as a reminder for businesses about the importance of using the right software for the right job.

“Loosing data due to the limits of the tool reminds us of the need for robust quality assurance along with understanding the risks from manual processes and user error,” said Walmsley.

“As part of Microsoft Office 365, the world’s most popular software as a service offering, let’s hope the UK government has taken a more robust approach to access and security controls around this sensitive data.”

​

The United Nations Climate Change Conference is coming to Glasgow in November 2021. Already, world leaders are being challenged on the commitments they will make in The Glasgow Statement. We are inviting you to use part of your 2021 home group, youth group, or Bible study group programme to join with others across the UK and Ireland in listening for God's call as we face up to the Climate Emergency.

​

Timetable & Duration

15th Sept to 27th Oct 2021

​

This course will take place online on Wednesday evenings, 7-9pm BST.

This course will occur for 7 weeks online.

​

Introduction to the course

This year, Glasgow will host COP26. Emphasising community action, the conference seeks to bring global powers ""together for our planet"". For many Christians this is an important and much anticipated event.

We feel called to fulfil our duty of care towards the creation which God called 'good', and every living thing. Come November, however, many of us will sit as onlookers to the conference, frustrated to be so distant from the action.

Faith, Hope + Climate Change invites churches and faith groups from across the UK to join us as we gather online together for our planet, and together in our faith. Trinity College Glasgow will host seven evenings, each aiming to equip you with the inspiration to approach climate change activism within your wider communities. Each evening, we will invite you to learn from high-profile scholars and speakers, and get involved through three innovative action tracks, which will inspire you and support you over the 7 weeks to take creative and prophetic action in your church and community.

​

Course Information

​

This course is designed for any church group which wants to get ready for COP26. All denominational backgrounds are welcome to join us and learn — no prior knowledge is required!

Glasgow is privileged to host COP26 — running this course online allows us to open up the opportunity for groups in different parts of the UK and Ireland to prepare together. We will use much of the same technology that many of you have been using for Church online. You will only need your computer, a Zoom account, and yourselves!

GSK has been confirmed as a Principal Partner of the UN Climate Change Conference 2021 (COP26), to be hosted in Glasgow by the UK government under its joint Presidency with Italy, in November 2021.

GSK is the COP26 Principal Partner for the pharmaceutical sector, building on the announcement of the company’s new global environmental sustainability targets in November 2020. Alongside the delivery of global climate and nature targets, the life sciences sector can play a leading role in addressing the health-related impacts of climate change, and this partnership provides an important opportunity to galvanise action across countries and organisations.

GSK Chief Executive, Emma Walmsley, said: “As a global science-based healthcare company, we want to play our part in helping protect and restore the planet’s health, in order to protect and improve people’s health. We know that taking actions to do so will make our business more resilient and support growth in the long term. We strongly believe that COP26 must accelerate global actions and collaborations to protect climate, nature and health and we are delighted to support the UK government with their ambitions for a successful COP26.”

As a Principal Partner, GSK will work closely with the COP26 team and the UK government to plan key climate and health focused events at the Conference, and on launching new initiatives in advance of November 2021 in support of COP26 and GSK’s environment and sustainability targets.

During the COP26 partnership, GSK will focus on several areas, including working alongside other leading health focused organisations to improve understanding and measurement of the impacts of climate change and nature loss on health. This will support improved health resilience globally, including as part of future pandemic preparedness, as we better understand how climate change and nature loss will impact disease burden and patient need so that life science research can respond in the future.

GSK will also leverage its COP26 role to act as a catalyst for the life sciences sector on the Race to Zero, supporting collaborative action on supply chain scope 3 emissions. Through the promotion and development of low carbon medical treatments and new models of care we believe that industry can support healthcare systems transition to net zero and promote climate ambition directly with global networks of peers, supply chains and partners.

Environmental sustainability is a key part of GSK’s focused ESG approach to support the delivery of sustainable long-term business performance, reduced risk and increased social impact.

Key GSK progress since November 2020

As part of progress toward the achievement of its renewed sustainability targets announced in November, GSK is already progressing significant contributory initiatives across its global business, including:

From June 2021, GSK will invite proposals from potential partners for the development of nature-based carbon removal projects that can tackle climate change, promote biodiversity and improve public health outcomes. Partners will be announced in late 2021.

On 13 May, GSK Consumer Healthcare, the world-leading consumer healthcare business, announced its commitment to make over a billion toothpaste tubes recyclable by 2025 as part of its ongoing sustainability journey. The company is partnering with two global packaging suppliers to launch fully recyclable toothpaste tubes across its specialist and science-based oral health brands.

At the White House Leaders Summit on Climate in April 2021, GSK was announced as a participant in the The Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition, an initiative with initial participation from the governments of Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other leading companies including Amazon, Airbnb, Bayer, Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey, Nestlé, Salesforce, and Unilever. Participants will support high-quality emissions reductions from tropical and subtropical forest countries, enabling efforts to reduce and end deforestation. This initiative aims to mobilize at least $1 billion in financing, kicking off what is expected to become one of the largest ever public-private efforts to help protect tropical forests, to the benefit of billions of people depending on them, and to support sustainable development.

These initiatives are in addition to GSK’s good progress on reductions in carbon and nature impact including:

a 32% reduction in scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions since 2017

68% of global electricity consumption now from renewable sources

Zero waste to landfill across global operations

We have an exotic mixture of wooden pallets, mud, tyres, sharp things, rusty things, heavy long metal things and long spiky things, along with some bike-scorched grass and a very rickety climbing frame. Unlike the Danish founders of junk yard adventure playgrounds who deliberately provided spaces to allow children to explore, our collection is just because the tip has been shut.

It didn’t take long for the neatly stacked parts from the disassembled trampoline to be raked through and creatively repurposed, along with the tyres and pallets and other things of danger. The children have taken over and made their own play space: over lockdown they’ve built dens, rafts, obstacle courses, speedboats, assorted machines, various factories, a Viking ship, a ‘secret’ bunker and a theatre with backstage ‘electrics’. Sometimes they are film props or settings for imaginative play, and sometimes it’s purely for the fun and challenge of building.

It’s also often risky – which is obviously part of the fun. It’s glorious to watch them creating and playing and working out the balance of risk and skill that fits their mood, and I’m happy for them to take risks like this because I can see it’s good for them. Lessons have been learned about things like why you need to be careful about dropping bricks when you’re not wearing shoes, how to get a splinter out and what happens when you clonk your brother with one of the long heavy things – but we have not (yet) had to visit A&E.

From the 1950s on, research around junk playgrounds showed the developmental importance of risky play – one of the positive outcomes being adults who can judge risk appropriately. Well, my childhood was quite high on junk and rusty bits, but it’s exactly this balance of risk versus benefit that I’m currently finding impossible.

Since lockdown has begun to be lifted and the risk-benefit judgements are increasingly handed over to individuals, the decisions have become endless. Venturing outside our garden, the array of risks we have to navigate has become a muddled cocktail.

While we were fully locked down, we knew what we were meant to do. One risk – of catching or passing on Covid-19 – surpassed all others. But now… There’s the risk of contravening increasingly complex (and sometimes arbitrary?) guidelines; the risk of offending people because you want to socialise with them but don’t want to break the rules; the risk of upsetting people because they think you don’t want to socialise with them; the risk of having forgotten how to socialise; the risk of bothering people by socialising in the wrong way; the risk of not socialising on your children’s well-being; the risk of socialising on your children’s health; the risk of returning FOMO; the risk of needing a pee when the public toilets are shut.

Plus, to paraphrase Nicola Sturgeon, surely our memories are not so short that we’ve forgotten how devastating this virus has been, and can still be. My memory of being low-risk but still ending up not having a very good time, is fresh. So add that subjective, experienced-based risk filter. And then add that small children are physiologically unable to maintain a 2m distance from anyone or anything, and in fact prefer to kiss/touch/lick/cuddle/sneeze on all things at all times. Throw all that into your risk-benefit matrix and… lockdown was lonely, but it was way less confusing.

So if the risks are many and baffling, intertwined and weighted with different benefits and probabilities – what to do? Eliminate? Mitigate? Embrace it? Find a new way of living with risk?

There’s apparently now a children’s playground designed to be infection-free in a time of pandemic: Rimbin keeps children in separate playpods. It’s completely risk and lick-free – and looks fairly funless. And of course that’s the thing: if we live fully, we live with risk all the time. And quite often risky is fun or the fun is risky; I know that’s the case in our garden. Until I can again make peace with the risks and find the fun, I might build a den."

The war in Ukraine has had a catastrophic effect on its people and, naturally, people across Scotland, the UK and the world have been moved to support them in some way.

How to support

OSCR has produced guidance for members of the public that wish to support the Ukrainian people and some of this advice will also be relevant for charities.

While it is up to trustees to determine how and who they wish to support, the key message from the referenced guidance is that the best way to support the people of Ukraine is to donate to charities registered in Scotland or the rest of the UK that have an ongoing relief operation in the region.

Every donor will want their contribution to be used in the best way possible; experienced aid organisations have the expertise and infrastructure to most effectively make use of funds that have been raised.

Charitable purposes

If you wish to raise funds on an ongoing basis or provide direct aid for Ukraine please ensure that these activities will still advance your charitable purposes as provided for in your governing document. If they do not, you must apply to OSCR for consent to change purposes first. OSCR will prioritise any applications for consent to change purposes to aid the people of Ukraine during the war as we have done for those applications we have already processed.

One off collections

As noted above, generally a charity that provides grants to other charities must ensure that it only does so in furtherance of its own charitable purposes. However, OSCR has taken the view that it can be acceptable for a charity, in the course of an event or activity, to collect money for another charity or appeal that does not have purposes similar to its own provided that:

It is incidental to the event or activity;

The intended appeal or beneficiary is clearly indicated to potential donors to remove any likelihood of them being misled into believing their donation is for the charity itself; and

Where necessary the charity has the permission of the body on whose behalf it is raising funds.

For example, if you wished to pass a collecting tin around the audience during the interval of a show to raise funds for the Disasters Emergency Committee’s (DEC) Ukraine appeal, you would not need to change your charitable purposes as long it was clear that the funds would be donated to the DEC. It is important that potential donors know exactly what their donation is being used for. However, if you were holding events specifically to raise funds for Ukraine, as opposed to any fundraising being ancillary to the main event, this would require a change to your purposes.

We would recommend that incidental one off fundraising is clearly recorded and accounted for so that it can be easily identified when your accounts are prepared.

Please note, all fundraising being carried out, whether for the charity in general or of the kind described above, should meet the standards set out in the Code of Fundraising Practice.

Management of funds

The suffering of both those in Ukraine and of refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries has instigated an enormous charitable response from people across Scotland and the UK.

While this is extremely heartening and something of which we should be rightfully proud, it can also lead to groups of people, unincorporated bodies and small charities with limited financial governance infrastructure suddenly receiving large sums of money.

Charity trustees must ensure they have appropriate financial controls in place. Our Guidance and Good Practice for Charity Trustees guidance has a section on Charity Finance which includes a section dedicated to financial controls.

Furthermore, there may be a temptation for ad hoc fundraising groups to ask a charity to ‘look after’ funds if the group doesn’t have a suitable means of managing the funds (for example if they don’t have a business bank account).

While this would not necessarily be in breach of charity legislation, the charity must give extremely careful consideration to the following points:

Would this be in the best interests of the charity and is it consistent with the charity’s purposes?

Are the charity’s resources protected and would this in any way put the assets of the charity at risk?

Are suitable controls over financial procedures in place to protect the charity’s assets and is there any risk that the charity’s own account could be misused?

How will the funds be monitored and what processes are in place to ensure they are spent correctly?

Have the funds been collected legitimately and for this specified purpose?

And, as with any decision, the trustees must give the matter their full consideration as to why it was in the best interests of the charity, ensure that their decisions are carefully documented and that the trustees can subsequently fully explain any decision they have made."

Elsa","monthly, arran, magazine, online, change, temperatures, prince, things, voice, christmas, weeks, coming, isle, wondering","Hello dear readers, and a very warm welcome to the new edition of the Voice for Arran. It is great to be back, although I am a little disoriented after the three months break since the last issue, and I have momentarily been wondering if it really is December, and not in fact October!

This disorientation however is also related to the slight feeling of ‘Groundhog Day’ I have been experiencing at times in recent weeks – the feeling that ‘events that have happened before happen again, in what seems to be exactly the same way.' That the Arran Outdoor Education Centre is at risk of closure again, and so soon after the last time it was threatened, is a depressing case in point. But in relation to many things going on in the world just now, I have been wondering - why is it that the same things seem to repeatedly occur with no apparent change or alteration?

Coming across Alison Prince’s piece, ‘The Year 2000’, in The Arran Naturalist added another layer of contemplation. Writing in 1990, in the light of the approaching millennium, Prince looks at the nature of our planet as a living entity and the “mystery in the whole set up"" being humankind. We could not survive without the earth, yet at the same time it seems we are doing all we can to destroy it – our energy consumption is increasing, we produce more things to buy, still “we are devoted to the idea of a constant improving standard of living”. She asks, “In 10 years time, how will this parasitic relationship have developed – or deteriorated?”

Her piece could well have been written today, with similar warnings coming from the UN, from scientists, environmental organisations and elsewhere. Amidst the Cop29 Conference and Global Plastics Treaty taking place last month, has come the news that 2024 is on track to be the warmest year on record, already hitting 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and without cuts to emissions, temperatures are heading towards a rise of 3.1°C. As Prince wrote over 30 years, “A race against time is going on.”

Sally Campbell’s report on the Cop29 that has just concluded in Azerbaijan provides a small chink of light, via the actions of the UK government and the new targets Sir Keir Starmer has committed to. Acting on recommendations from the Climate Change Committee, “He announced that the UK’s 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target will be to reduce emissions by at least 81% compared to 1990 levels by 2035.” While we will have to wait and see if these policies are backed up with concrete action, they at least reflect a possibility of change in what seems to be an otherwise overwhelming trajectory towards rising global temperatures driven by oil and gas interests.

Prince writes, “In the coming decade, we as a species will have to accept the fact that we cannot do as we like, but only as the earth permits us."" While for many this statement may sound like a restriction on their individual liberty, in the face of relentless environmental disregard it feels to me instead to be about making planet positive choices, and about acting on our human capacity - perhaps this is the ""mystery"" - to be able to do things differently in the space that each new moment brings.

I have yet to find myself in the Christmas spirit, but with some of the lovely things happening in the coming weeks, including a Corrie Christmas Film Club, Eco Savvy's Christmas Fair and the Lamlash Drama Club’s annual panto, there is still time! We hope you enjoy the issue and from all of us at the Voice we wish you a happy and peaceful festive time... Elsa"

“Today is a very significant day in the history of our nation and within our sorrow at The Queen’s passing we must also acknowledge the considerable contribution and example of public duty she made during her long reign.

“For the majority of people she was the only monarch they have ever known and her passing also brings to a close the modern Elizabethan era. Over the 70+ years of her reign she had been witness to many significant world events from the sadness of wars and conflicts to the joy of technological progress including the introduction of the Internet and major medical advancements that have eradicated previously endemic diseases such as polio.

“She was the most widely travelled monarch of all time visiting countries in all five continents but of course also retained a particular fondness for Scotland. She visited East Lothian on a number of occasions – the most recent visit was in 2016 to mark the 200th anniversary of Musselburgh Racecourse.

“During 2022, the year of her Platinum Jubilee, local communities across East Lothian including schools, businesses, community groups and individuals embraced the challenge of the Queen’s Green Canopy and planted trees in a variety of sites across the county that will serve as enduring tributes to her reign.

“East Lothian joins the rest of the nation, Commonwealth and wider world in a period of mourning that acknowledges the passing of an incredible individual whose commitment and longevity to public duty is unlikely to ever be equalled.”

Lord-Lieutenant’s message of condolence

East Lothian’s Lord-Lieutenant, Roderick Urquhart, today said: ""I am deeply saddened by the death of Her Majesty The Queen. I send my most sincere condolences to all of the Royal Family on behalf of the East Lothian Lieutenancy and the people of East Lothian.

“For more than 70 years, HM The Queen led a life of incomparable public service and duty dedicated to the nation. She was not just the Head of State of the UK and Head of the Commonwealth, but was also a figurehead of selfless devotion, dedication and service. She leaves a legacy which is unlikely to be matched for many generations.

“Her visits to East Lothian were many and varied over the years, and in particular I have happy memories of her visiting the Lamp of Lothian in Haddington in 2007, and joining the bicentenary celebrations of Musselburgh Racecourse in 2016.

“As Lord-Lieutenant I have been fortunate to carry out many duties on behalf of The Queen, including the presentation of Honours to local residents, and celebrating 100th birthdays and Diamond Wedding anniversaries, as well as presenting Queen's Awards. On each of these occasions I have been aware of the huge respect and fondness for our monarch.

The recent Platinum Jubilee celebrations highlighted the desire of people of all ages to mark the occasion. In East Lothian, the Queen’s Green Canopy Platinum Jubilee initiative has resulted in many trees being planted across the county, by school and community groups, local businesses and individual residents, all of which together will leave a lasting legacy for future generations.

“Whilst in this period of mourning, we must also recognise the succession within the monarchy, and the inheritance of the Crown by her heir, Charles. As King, Charles will inevitably be a different monarch, but one who will help evolve a new modern relevance to the monarchy, as well as being a true and confident successor to HM The Queen, in continuing the twin roles of head of state and head of the nation and Commonwealth, in the 21st Century.”

The Free Church of Scotland is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Her 70 year reign has been characterised by continuous and wholehearted commitment to what she believed was her God given position as sovereign over the United Kingdom.

We are deeply thankful for her many years of service and the important principles she stood for, most notably her personal faith in Jesus Christ, which was made evident in her consistent conduct and regular broadcasts.

However, according to council figures at least, the ceremony to crown her successor on May 6 has been greeted by ""tepid indifference"" by the Scottish public.

At least three local authorities have had no requests for permission to host street parties or other events for the coronation of King Charles III.

Glasgow has bowed to its own tradition of giving Royal events a lukewarm reception.

The council said no applications had been received to shut roads or issue temporary entertainment or alcohol licenses.

Neither Falkirk or Clackmannanshire appear to have been swept up by the occasion either.

Of those that replied to The Herald, Edinburgh is the only city where applications reached double figures. The council has had 12 requests to host official events.

Aberdeenshire, the home of Balmoral Castle, received five applications but is hosting at least eight other events, which do not require local authority permissions.

Communities have been encouraged to host Big Lunch events, which raise money for charity and generally do not require council permission.

According to the website, Scotland is hosting 215 events, with numbers highest in the borders area and virtually none being held in the North West Highlands.

Council officials in East Ayrshire, which takes in towns including Kilmarnock, Cumnock and Galson, said they had been notified of eight, private community events taking place but none had required permission.

Fife did not receive any applications for parties but is hosting at least five community events.

""To a historian these figures are fascinating,"" said Professor Tom Devine, professor emeritus of history at Edinburgh University.

""Only Edinburgh of all areas in Scotland will have the number of planned coronation street parties which narrowly reach double figures. Glasgow apparently will have none.

""The public rejoicing at the late Queen’s coronation in 1953 could not a have been more different.

""Then there were thousands of street parties and other events throughout the country and a wonderful mood of communal celebration among the people on the great day itself.

""I can still remember the joyous party in my own street in Motherwell with food aplenty, fun, sports competitions going on all day and well into the evening. Everyone came together to rejoice.

""Monarchy is of course less popular today, particularly in Scotland and especially among those aged below 50 than it was in 1953.""

However, Prof Devine said the shift in mood ""runs deeper"" than simply declining support for the monarchy.

""It was quite simply a different era,"" he said.

""The early 1950s seemed like the dawn of a new and more optimistic age and not just the start of a new reign

""War and post-war austerity(notably rationing) ended.

""The economy was booming and unemployment fell below 2%.

""The historic Labour Party ‘cradle to grave’ welfare reforms of the 1940s were now having a massively beneficial impact on the lives of working-class people.

""For the countless families who had endured the misery of the economic depressions in the 1930s and then the most devastating global conflict the world had ever seen, there was indeed much to celebrate in 1953.

""The reasons to rejoice on that scale in 2023 seem much less obvious.""

Aberdeen is among the Scottish councils hosting official events with a family day on Sunday May 7 at Duthie Park, while Edinburgh is hosting a coronation ball.

Nairn will mark the occasion with a pipe band display, while Big Lunch events are taking place in towns including Linwood in Paisley, Galashiels, Irvine and Montrose."

Readers might be forgiven for wondering how long it’s going to take the SNP to accept that that “strategy” is a failure, if seven years and three First Ministers isn’t enough for them to have worked it out. But as long as the pathologically gullible keep voting for them anyway, we suppose they have no reason to."

Barnier Bash: France’s Government Suffers No Confidence Vote

On the 4th of December, France’s government collapsed following a no confidence vote, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister and erstwhile Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. His government broke after failing to pass the 2025 budget, which contained €40bn in spending cuts and €20bn in tax rises. These policies were opposed by two of the three major bloc’s in France’s Parliament: the left-wing Nouveau Front Populaire and the populist right-wing Rassemblement Nationale, led by Marine le Pen.Seoul Over: South Korea’s President Faces Impeachment

South Korea’s National Assembly voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on December 14th. He had already survived a previous vote earlier in the month, but on this occasion votes from members of his own People’s Power Party (PPP) ensured the motion to impeach him got the necessary two-thirds majority. Yoon faced these calls for impeachment after declaring martial law on December 3rd, suggesting that the National Assembly, controlled by the Democratic Party (DP) since last summer’s elections, were a threat to South Korean democracy and even implying that they were collaborating with North Korea.

In Brief

Jimmy Carter, who served as President of the US between 1975 and 1980, died aged 100 on the 29th of December. His notable policy achievements include pardoning those who had dodged the draft for the Vietnam War and facilitating the signing of the Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt.

An additional £350 million will go to those most affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell has announced.

The funding will be made available to councils, charities, businesses and community groups and designed to be flexible, cutting down on red tape to enable them to respond swiftly and according to local need for people impacted economically or through reduced contact with society, including anyone struggling to access food.

Ms Campbell said allowing a high level of flexibility was the best way to ensure they were most effective. She said:

“This pandemic will disrupt lives like never before and cause financial hardship and negatively impact on our wellbeing. Be assured, however, that protecting and supporting people during these unparalleled times is the absolute focus of this government.

“Our funding package will be focused on delivery, not bureaucracy or red tape. Local authorities, local businesses, community groups and the third sector know and understand the support needs of their communities the best. Where people and organisations have solutions or ideas, I want to hear them.”

“Unless we work with local partners the impact of our investment will not be felt by those that need it most. So my message today is – if we can help you to help the people of Scotland then we will.”

Background

The emergency funding package will be allocated to existing funding streams through several new funds, with the £95 million package direct to local authorities made up of:

£50 million in Barnett consequentials from the UK Government’s hardship fund is being passed direct to local authorities to support their own local resilience, support and hardship plans.

£45 million will be added to the existing Scottish Welfare Fund which makes Community Grants and Crisis Grants available to those in immediate need. This more than doubles the current £35.5 million fund, which is administered by local authorities. They will be given more flexibility in how it is used to ensure they can fully support people in financial crisis, including workers in the ‘gig economy’.

In addition:

a £70 million Food Fund will help organisations in the public, private and voluntary sectors address issues of food insecurity, especially for older people, and families who may not be able to rely on free school meals

a £50 million Wellbeing Fund will help charities and others who require additional capacity to work with at-risk people who may be worst affected by the crisis, including homeless people and those experiencing fuel poverty

a £40 million Supporting Communities Fund will be used to support the rapidly growing and inspiring community efforts at a local level which will be vital to national resilience, including supporting people at risk because of age, isolation, carers, homeless people and asylum seekers and signposting people to sources of help such as applying for benefits

£50 million will go to meet an anticipated increase in applications for the existing Council Tax Reduction Scheme and Scottish social security benefits

£20 million will be allocated to a Third Sector Resilience Fund, to help ensure the health and continued viability of the third sector organisations affected by cash flow and other problems, which have a key role to play in our national response

£25 million will be kept in reserve to allow swift and flexible responses to rapidly changing circumstances

A helpline providing businesses across Scotland with advice and guidance on COVID-19 has been announced by Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop.



The helpline, which is now live, will be open Monday to Friday, between 8.30am to 5.30pm.



Based at Scottish Enterprise’s existing call centre in Clydebank, advisers across Scotland will answer questions from businesses related to COVID-19. The helpline will also help the Scottish Government identify the current challenges facing businesses.



On Thursday the First Minister confirmed that the Scottish and UK Governments are moving from the containment phase to delay, and that large gatherings of over 500 people will be cancelled to support the resilience of emergency services.



The Chief Medical Officer has advised people with mild symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 including continuing coughing, or a fever or a temperature of above 37.8 should self-isolate for seven days. Those who have been in contact with someone who is experiencing symptoms should only self-isolate if they begin to experience symptoms.



During a meeting with representatives from Scotland’s business support organisations including the STUC this week, Ms Hyslop stressed the importance of everyone following the latest COVID-19 advice.



Ms Hyslop said:



“Scotland is well-prepared for a significant outbreak of coronavirus but people have a vital role to play in helping us contain any outbreak by following the latest health and travel advice.



“This situation presents a significant risk to global and domestic economic activity. That is why today we are launching a business helpline which will provide companies in Scotland with the support and guidance they need to respond appropriately.



“We continue to work closely with our partners to identify what further support businesses need. For example, the Minister for Local Government and Planning and the Chief Planner wrote to all planning authorities this week encouraging them to relax their approach to the enforcement of planning restrictions on shop delivery times and opening hours.



“I also chaired a meeting with representatives from Scotland’s business support organisations including the STUC to hear their concerns and provide reassurance that the Scottish Government will do everything in our power to protect the workforce, businesses and our economy.



“I’d also encourage everyone to refer to the new guidance on COVID-19 that includes workplace advice on reducing the spread of infection.



“Following the UK Government’s budget we also require urgent clarification on what funding Scotland will receive from the announcements made by the UK Government, at a time when prospects for the economy and public finances remain very uncertain as the short term impacts of COVID-19 unfold.”

Background:

The business helpline number is 0300 303 0660. The helpline will be open Monday to Friday 8.30am to 5.30pm.

Callers should select option one to speak to the COVID-19 team.

People with symptoms told to stay at home.

First Minister announces large events to be cancelled.

Last week new guidance on Covid-19 that includes workplace advice was published.

Further additional guidance and information, including links to guidance for travellers and the general public, can also be found on HPS’ COVID-19 page.

The latest numbers of test results are published at 2pm each day on the Scottish Government website."

Women’s equality advocates often find ourselves talking about the same structural and systemic issues again and again (it’s almost like we live in a society where men overwhelmingly hold the power, eh?)
While it can’t neutralise the grief and fear we are all feeling, there are opportunities for this crisis management to embed measures which make work, care, and community better for all.

This blog from our Communications and Engagement Manager, Alys Mumford, sets out why we've released a paper on women and COVID-19, and why we must never stop talking about women's equality.

The world is a new and confusing place for many of us. A rollercoaster of changes to work, school and care schedules, getting to grips with online meetings and digital lessons, fear for our friends, families and neighbours.

It will come as no surprise to any woman reading this that when crises like the one we are facing right now hit, women are disproportionately affected. More likely to be in precarious and low-paid work, more likely to shoulder additional caring responsibilities, and more likely to be the one worrying about food shopping, dentist trips, and prescriptions.

Today Engender has released a paper exploring the impacts of COVID-19 on women, and setting out what must be done in order not to lose the gains we have made towards equality. Women’s equality advocates often find ourselves talking about the same structural and systemic issues again and again (it’s almost like we live in a society where men overwhelmingly hold the power, eh?) and so too with this briefing. And that’s because old problems don’t go away when new ones come along. But new problems, and hasty responses to them, can further entrench injustices and inequalities. It is therefore vital that we integrate gender into any responses to this latest crisis.

Social security, employment, social care, health, and violence against women, are all areas of women’s inequality which will see additional challenges due to coronavirus, and which must be taken into account in the responses of national and local government. Our report makes several recommendations for practical solutions to uphold women’s rights and work towards equality during this period of uncertainty, as well as calling for creativity in finding ways to change systems to enable women’s protection and wellbeing.

In the briefing you will also find reasons for (measured) optimism. While it can’t neutralise the grief and fear we are all feeling, there are opportunities for this crisis management to embed measures which make work, care, and community better for all. Employers realising that home working isn’t that hard, universities forced to look beyond a letter on a page during admissions, and huge investment in our health service. Just a few weeks ago, new migration rules divided people into ‘skilled’ and ‘unskilled’ workers. Now much is made, rightly so, of the crossover between ‘unskilled workers’ and those now designated as ‘key workers’, indicating a new awareness of the importance of women’s undervalued and unseen work.

This is a situation which is moving incredibly fast, with new science, guidelines and announcements appearing day by day. One thing is constant though; the need to include women’s equality at the heart of our response.

All COVID-19 insights articles

Governments were looking to individuals and institutions to help attenuate and then reverse the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Universities, and in particular the University of Glasgow, were at the forefront of measures to support the health service in responding to the medical crises.

The economic and social crises also needed urgent insights and innovative ideas for the ‘hammer’, ‘dance’ and ‘reconstruction’ phases.

Beyond insights for health behaviours, there were urgent demands to understand the implications of large-scale fiscal and monetary policies – e.g. what did they mean for livelihoods, for local communities and for inclusion?

There were immediate imperatives to help policymakers understand and mitigate effects on businesses, jobs, unemployment, reduced asset prices, depleted savings, and disrupted mobility patterns. It was critical to get to grips with the challenges faced by children and their families living in poverty, particularly those in neighbourhoods with the highest levels of disadvantage.

We needed to better understand the impact of school closures and the wider reduction of public and third sector provision on a diverse range of outcomes, particularly on health and wellbeing. What did it mean for the homeless, the increasing numbers of evicted tenants, and the young and old homeowners running out of resources to pay their mortgages? How could we abate and reverse these effects of the crises?

There was also the shaping of the ‘reconstruction’: investing and planning for the longer term in the wake of the lessons and consequences of coronavirus (COVID-19). This meant a second phase of university-based support in mobilising policy relevant innovations and knowledge stemming from the economic, social and governance understandings within universities’ research communities.

What we did

Policy Scotland served as a conduit for policy relevant knowledge, mobilising insights and evidence from Glasgow and used our contacts and networks to connect colleagues in Glasgow University with policymakers, while also bringing ideas from the best experts elsewhere in the UK and internationally about what might work to deal effectively with the public health, economic and social crises we face.

The key audience for this work was those who were wrestling with the problems that coronavirus (COVID-19) and the disruption caused to normal working created but we also saw an opportunity for policy discussion between academics and policymakers.

Beyond that lies a future which can be characterised as a ‘rethinking and reconstruction phase’ in which social, economic and policy structures for the future might be altered, both to deal with post-crisis circumstances and potentially shifting beliefs about the roles of individuals, communities and governments.

Constitutional questions

A second independence vote would need the UK government’s agreement

Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said that the outcome of the EU referendum meets the conditions for holding a second referendum on Scottish independence, as laid out in the SNP’s manifesto:

“...the Scottish Parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there is … a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will.”

In order to hold another independence referendum, the UK government would have to agree.

Ms Sturgeon has stated that she will “explore every option” for protecting Scotland’s position in the EU.

The law on devolution will probably have to be changed

The Scotland Act 1998, which devolved some powers to Scotland, says that Scottish Parliament laws must be compatible with EU laws. This will probably have to be changed.

The UK government says that it won’t generally change any devolved legislation without the approval of the Scottish Parliament, and Ms Sturgeon has said that she will ask it to refuse consent to the change.

If the Scottish Parliament doesn’t give its approval, making the change could be politically controversial. This won’t stop the UK from being able to leave the EU, as it retains the power to overrule the Scottish Parliament if it wants to.

Currently, Scotland can’t join the EU as a member in its own right

The UK government is responsible for managing relations with the EU, and any other international treaties, on behalf of Scotland, as well as implementing EU economic policies and elements of single market legislation.

The Scottish government is responsible for implementing EU regulations that relate to devolved powers, such as agriculture, fisheries and the environment. It also administers EU funding in Scotland, including Structural Funds and the Common Agricultural Policy.

Scotland isn’t classed as a state under international law, so it isn’t capable of signing and ratifying international treaties or conducting its own foreign relations. Currently, Scotland couldn’t be an EU member in its own right, nor could it sign an Association Agreement with the EU.

Some countries and territories have a special relationship with the EU without being member countries in their own right. Overseas Countries and Territories have duty- and quota-free access to the EU single market for goods, and automatically receive better terms of trade in services. But all of them are linked to a current EU member, rather than being part of a non-member, as the UK will become.

If Scotland wanted to become one of these countries, the definition in the EU treaties would have to change. The current definition is ‘the non-European countries and territories which have special relations with Denmark, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom’.

If Scotland became independent, it’s not certain on what terms it could become an EU member

There has never been a case where part of an EU country has become independent and then had to determine its membership as a separate state—let alone when the rest of the country is leaving the EU.

The House of Commons Library says that there are at least three general possibilities for what could happen, depending on how Scottish independence was categorised under international law.

If Scottish independence was classed as a ‘continuation’ of the UK and ‘secession’ of Scotland, the rest of the UK would retain its treaty obligations and membership of international organisations but Scotland would not. If Scottish independence was classed as a ‘separation’ of the UK, both Scotland and the rest of the UK would retain these obligations and memberships. If it was classed as a ‘dissolution’ of the UK, both Scotland and the rest of the UK would lose them.

The Library says that the first of these options would be the most likely in this scenario, but because the rest of the UK does not want to keep its EU treaty obligations a different outcome is possible.

The 1978 Vienna Convention sets out how a newly-independent country could sign up to treaties that were in force in its territory before independence, simply by notifying the other countries in the treaties. But the UK hasn’t signed this treaty.

Whatever the position in international law, the House of Commons Library says a decision on Scotland’s status in the EU is likely to be a political one.

If all the EU member countries agreed, they might be able to find a way for an independent Scotland to inherit the UK’s place, subject to negotiations on the details of membership.

On the other hand, the Library points out, EU member countries with concerns about separatist movements in their own countries might argue that Scotland should lose its membership along with the rest of the UK, and hold up or even veto any process for Scotland to join.

Scotland’s economy and the EU

Around 42% of Scotland’s international exports went to the EU in 2014, the most recent year for which these statistics are available, worth about £11.6 billion. Six of Scotland’s top ten export destinations were EU countries.

Non-EU countries receive an increasing share of Scotland’s international exports. Exports to the EU have grown by 6% since 2002, while exports to the rest of the world have grown by 74%.

Between 2009 and 2013, non-UK European businesses were responsible for about 15.6% of the value added by businesses to the Scottish economy, totalling about £15.8 billion. This is the highest share of any UK country or region. This includes activity by businesses from non-EU countries in Europe, in particular Norway and Switzerland.

Migration and the EU

Like other EU citizens, Scottish citizens have had a right to work and study across the EU. Whether free movement continues after the UK has left the EU will depend on what agreement we make with the EU.

Between 1973 (when the UK joined the EU) and 2003, the Scottish population either saw minimal growth or decreased in size. Since 2004, Scotland’s population has increased by about 0.5% every year.

The National Records of Scotland attribute this increase, in part, to immigration from the eight central and eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004.

Higher Education

Students from EU countries outside of the UK can study at Scottish universities for free. In 2013-14, 13,550 EU students from outside the UK studied at Scottish universities, costing the Scottish Government £25.6 million.

Read more about how higher education might be affected by leaving the EU here.

European funding

Scotland has benefited from European funds being spent in Scotland, but it has also contributed payments to the EU budget as part of the UK. Research by the Scottish Government has found that Scotland is in effect a net contributor to the EU budget, as the UK as a whole is.

Between 2007 and 2013, Scotland benefited from around €4.5 billion of Common Agricultural Policy funding. A further €4.6 billion had been earmarked for Scotland from 2014-2020.

Between 2007 and 2013 Scotland also received around €800 million in European Structural Funds.

Scotland has benefited from the EU’s research and development funding, which organisations have to compete for. Scottish organisations were awarded over €111 million from the Horizon 2020 programme in the allocations made up to June 2015. UK universities will probably lose access to EU research funding when we leave the EU."

On Thursday the 30th of March 2017, Faslane Peace Camp (the worlds longest running active protest site and a frontline in the fight against nuclear weapons of mass destruction), was honoured to host a visit by the Hibakusha Reiko Yamada and Midori Yamada together with their translator and fellow anti-nuclear activist Shigeo Kobayashi (a member of Japanese Against Nuclear – JAN) and many visitors from SCND (Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament).

It seems almost unthinkable that any living thing could survive the blast of the atomic bomb, “Little Boy”, that was dropped on Hiroshima at 8:15am, August 6th, 1945. 80,000 – 140,000 people were killed instantly and a further 100,000 seriously injured. In less than a second, “the fireball had expanded to 900 feet. The blast wave shattered windows for a distance of ten miles and was felt as far away as 37 miles. Over two-thirds of Hiroshima’s buildings were demolished. The hundreds of fires, ignited by the thermal pulse, combined to produce a firestorm that had incinerated everything within about 4.4 miles of ground zero.”

Half an hour later, a “black rain“, full of dirt, dust, soot and highly radioactive particles began falling in areas northwest of the city. Hiroshima was in ruins. Familiar landmarks were gone or unrecognizable. Buildings – even strong modern structures – had suffered significant damage, some pushed off their foundations, some gutted by fire, others utterly destroyed.

Incredibly some people did endure the blast. These survivors, (known as Hibakusha) sought relief from their dreadful injuries. But, “90 percent of all medical personnel were killed or disabled, and the remaining medical supplies quickly ran out. Many survivors began to notice the effects of exposure to the bomb’s radiation. Their symptoms ranged from nausea, bleeding and loss of hair, to death. Flash burns, a susceptibility to leukemia, cataracts and malignant tumors were some of the other effects.”

The visit by the Hibakusha to Faslane Peace Camp was part of a busy one week trip to the UK, with many meetings including a trip to both the English and Scottish parliaments. Their tour coincides with the current Nuclear ban treaty negotiations (boycotted by the English, US, French, Japanese, etc.). Reiko and Midori met with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Wednesday who stated that she is “totally against nuclear weapons” – a very important consideration to remember when the vote for Scottish Independence takes place between late 2018 and early 2019.

(Reiko Yamada & Midori Yamada beside the cherry tree at Faslane Peace Camp that was planted by two other Hibakusha in 1985)

After a few introductory words by Arthur West (Chair of SCND) Reiko and Midori told their story.

Reiko Yamada started by saying that she respects Faslane Peace Camper’s continuous efforts against nuclear weapons and that she “feels so strong having seen that we actively stand against them”.

Reiko says – “I was bombed and irradiated when I was 11 years old at primary school. When the bomb dropped so many people were injured and died that you couldn’t walk through the streets because there were bodies everywhere. There were so many injured, with burnt skin dropping off and trapped beneath buildings – too many people to do anything but look.

For three days the fire raged. The people close to the epicentre were terribly burned and then came the “black rain”. People were desperate to get out, but they couldn’t.

I saw the flash, then came the blast. When I came to I didn’t know what had happened.

My father managed to stand up but he’d been cut to pieces by broken glass. My sister was really badly burned. There was no medication available so my father and sister really suffered. They were really fortunate that they could make it home – many people just disappeared and never made it home. Still, to this day, many people cannot know what happened to their family and friends who disappeared.

Any bodies that could be collected were brought to the school field and cremated – many bodies. These people suffered a lot of burns and were probably conscious for quite some time. Bodies were cremated en masse.

So we say nuclear weapons are inhuman and evil, they kill indiscriminately and make everyone collapse and die.

For the last 60 years we Hibakusha have been telling the world that nuclear weapons are evil and should not exist. But we must admit, over 15,000 nuclear weapons still exist and the nuclear nations like to make more. We keep telling them our message, that these things are terrible but the nation states are not listening, including the UK. However, we must make the effort.

Of course we like to continue to raise our voices, particularly whilst the important nuclear ban treaty discussions take place – we would like to shout out with you “NO MORE NUCLEAR WEAPONS”.

I say again that I respect your efforts – please continue hand in hand with us – please get rid of all nuclear weapons. We will go back to Tokyo and tell others about your efforts here at Faslane Peace Camp.”

(Photo: Reiko Yamada points to the Japanese character for “Peace & Harmony”)

(Photo: Midori tells the story of her brother Jiro-chan)

Midori Yamada, 2nd generation Hibakusha had this to say:

“I also respect the people staying here at Faslane Peace Camp and keeping an eye on the submarines. My father was Hibakusha and I am the second generation. I was born in a small town on the outskirts of Hiroshima. It was a very quiet, peaceful town. I was born in 1949 but still now, I am affected by the scar of the atom-bomb – it is very deep in people’s minds. I particularly respect Reiko for visiting and spreading the Hibakusha message.

Thankfully a third atom-bomb has not been used yet. The efforts of the Hibakusha is to say never again. However, we must admit that the Hibakusha are getting older and dieing and their numbers are decreasing. So the second generation must continue to make extra effort to bring our message to the world.

Last year on August 6th, I published a book called “Jiro-chan – Story of a Hiroshima Boy” (ISBN 978-4-434-222-52-8). Jiro-chan was 13 years old when the atom-bomb was dropped. He was bright and cheerful, a bit like a clown – he would often do a funny dance when his sisters sang for example.

On August 6th 1945, Jiro-chan and his classmates were working demolishing houses (boys and girls were often involved in such work because of the war – creating fire-breaks and the like) when they saw the detonation of the atom-bomb. After the roll call he and his classmates had just started work – then there was a strong flash of light and the following percussion wave knocked Jiro-chan unconscious.

When he came to, he found himself trapped under rubble. Fire was approaching but the boys and girls trapped under the rubble couldn’t move. They encouraged each other to try to escape and cried for help – “Help us, help us please!” – but their voices weren’t heard.

Desperately struggling he finally got loose and managed to escape. The next moment the flames reared up like a giant monster and killed all his friends.

For 3 days Jiro-chan talked incessantly about the hell he’d witnessed, then he fell into a long and deep sleep.

After 3 months he regained his senses but was no longer happy and cheerful – it was as if he’d changed into someone else.

All his classmates were burned and he felt guilty that he’d survived. He had a deep scar inside.

On March 11th 2011, in the aftermath of an earthquake, was a big accident at Fukushima. Japan suffered damage from nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki but now it was nuclear power that had caused the problem and Jiro-chan felt bad that he hadn’t yet spoken out – “I should have informed many people about the atrocity of the atom-bombs and consoled the memory of my friends who died that day”, he said.

At 80 years old he started to talk about what happened on August 6th 1945 – he talks as if he offers prayers for his deceased friends.

Jiro-chan is my dear big brother.”

Obviously, its been an exceptionally emotional day for us all here at Peace Camp and we owe a great debt of gratitude to Reiko Yamada, Midori Yamada, Shigeo Kobayashi and SCND – to hear these stories first hand revivified our spirits and makes us even more determined to help rid Scotland and the world of the monstrous threat of nuclear weapons of mass destruction. Also we would like to thank Midori Yamada for her gift to Faslane Peace Camp – a copy of her book “Jiro-chan – Story of a Hiroshima Boy” – even though we can’t read it without crying.

It seems somewhat ironic that a Vanguard class submarine berthed at HMNB Clyde the previous day as part of the current “Joint Warrior” exercise. The aftermath of the atomic-bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is burned deep into the psyche of many Japanese people and the sheer horror of it lurks just beneath the surface of consciousness in all of us that have, at the very least, heard of this despicable act of indiscriminate mass murder – just like the Vanguard submarines malevolently lurking beneath the waves in anticipation of delivering their catastrophic payload.

As Reiko Yamada says – “Even 64 years after the bombing, we survivors still vividly remember those who desperately cried for help: their cries and memories are not gone; we are still tormented with remorse that we could not help them. Many of us also are suffering from the after-effects of radiation and from the fear of death.

I sincerely hope that people all over the world understand how a single atomic bomb could destroy a city and kill a large number of people indiscriminately and cruelly.

We Hibakusha call the atomic bombs ‘weapons of the devil’. We cannot allow even a single bomb to exist on this planet.

Nuclear weapons should be abolished to ensure a peaceful future.

The damage of atomic bombings should not be repeated.

The pain of the victims of that day must not be forgotten.

We must not allow nuclear weapons to continue to exist.

We call on you: No More Hiroshimas! No More Nagasakis! No More Hibakusha!”."

How much?

With negotiations ongoing between the local community and the Church of Scotland over the purchase of Portnahaven Church, it is notable from comparison with other, larger churches, on the Church of Scotland's property website, that the asking price for the Rhinns' church seems somewhat on the high side.

Considerably larger churches with steeples and bell towers can be seen for prices close to £60,000, while purchase of the diminutive property in Portnahaven is rumoured to be £120,500.

An independent valuation of the property held it to be worth under £40,000, so the Ileach contacted the Church of Scotland to enquire why the asking price was quite so high, and considerably above the independent valuation?

The similarly sized Kilmeny Church in Ballygrant was allegedly on offer for nearer £80,000.

Avoiding the question almost entirely, the Church of Scotland replied, stating, ""We are still in discussions with the community group.

""In terms of valuations of our buildings, the Church of Scotland does not undertake valuations; instead we use chartered surveyors to make a determination on the value of our properties. A Red book valuation (which is what we provide) is a comprehensive assessment that provides a legally defensible market value for a property.

""There will be many variables considered in terms of what makes up a valuation price.""

The Friends of Portnahaven Church told the Ileach that, although things have been quiet for a while, negotiations were continuing with the Church of Scotland.

""Our application to the Scottish Land Fund has been submitted, and we are ever hopeful of a breakthrough! We couldn't do this without the support of the community, far and wide, and we will update you again as soon as we know more.

Home to Laggan Bay

Development at family-owned Ian Macleod Distillers' latest single malt whisky distillery at Laggan Bay, has been moving ahead in recent months. On site at Glenegedale, both warehouse and main production buildings are almost complete, and key distilling and milling equipment has been arriving on the island, including two brand new copper stills, delivered last week by Forsyth's.

Working in partnership with The Islay Boys, Ian Macleod Distillers is on schedule for Laggan Bay to start full-scale distilling in summer 2025.

Newly appointed distillery manager, Malcom Rennie, who was previously manager at Rosebank Distillery, as well as many other iconic distilleries, has just taken up residence on the island. Malcom said, ""Itâs a dream come true to be back home and a real privilege to be part of creating a brand-new Islay whisky.""

Book review

Evening Song. Gil Waugh. Amazon paperback. 364pp. £11.93

Imagine, if you will, that in the future, or even the present, if Gil Waugh's 'Evening Song' is to be believed, it is discovered that humans possess a gene containing ""...the elusive combination of genetic sequences, and the unique formatin of small peptides"" that provide the basis for what you and I would refer to as 'instinct'.

A Canadian research team, known only as T3 has not only discovered this 'hereditary architecture' but a 'genetic memory' responsible for encoding memories that can be passed onto future generations.

Murray Sacken, overseer of this research, has been working with Tormod Siosoloch on developing it to its ultimate conclusion, neither fully appraised of its implications. Tormod, however, wary that he and the research could be separated at anytime due to pressures from above, has taken to encoding detailed information by means of what his colleagues referred to as 'doodles' in an innocent looking sketchbook.

When Murray Sacken turns up dead, only a day or so after confiscating Tormod's sketches, though apparently unaware of their purpose, he realises that matters may already be out of hand.

Minus that sketchbook, Tormod uses various means of deception to disappear from Canada, eventually arriving via convoluted means, at Orsay Island, off the southern tip of Islay, where he adopts the life of an eccentric who only ever speaks Gaelic.

Meanwhile, back in the present, Karen and Steve, private investigators, are contacted by Jack Sacken, Murray's son, following the apparent murder of his mother, Gisela Sacken.

What the heck is going on?

Karen and Steve come upon Tormod's sketchbook, hidden in a bag amongst Murray Sacken's possessions, but have no idea what it is, or how much trouble it's about to drop them in from a great height.

And who is the mysterious 'Viper' who they manage to contact on an encrypted message board? Is he friendly? How does he know so much about the sketchbook? And where in the world is he?

Ottowa-based, author, Gil Waugh, has written an intriguing, compulsive and often tense adventure novel, that strays ever so slightly into the realms of science fiction. Even the fictional genetic research he describes seems highly credible on the printed page.

It would be most improper to let you know how it all ends (if, in fact, it does), but it's well worth acquiring a copy to find out.

St Mungo Museum is named after the city's patron saint who brought the Christian faith to Glasgow in the 6th century. It is built on the site of the medieval Bishops’ Castle and is designed in its style. The galleries are full of displays, objects and stunning works of art that explore the importance of religion in peoples’ lives across the world and across time.

The venue aims to promote understanding and respect between people of different faiths and those of none and offers something for everyone. There are regular events, from family-friendly activities to talks about culture and religion in Scotland today. Or you can relax in the first Zen garden in Britain.
